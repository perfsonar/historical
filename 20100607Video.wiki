 # Milestone Status
   * Base 1 is done
   * Base 2 is in progress (Aaron to create RPM repo in the next day or so)
     * Eric having some trouble with RPM packages (e.g. some need very basic deps)
   * Base 3 is also in progress. Web RPMs added to kick start already
   * Base 4 is largly testing, and will start after 2 and 3 are done.  
     * May need to push back due date.  Delays in building and availability of Eric.  
   * LiveCD 1
     * Tool itegration in progress.  Backing store/passwords.  Ramdisk procedure will take the longest, and wil dicate when this is done.  Aaron thinks this can be tested in parallel with the KS files.  
   * Install DVD
     * Eric in progress. Will be very hard to test due to the cost/availability of DVDs for many testers.  Should consider a process to break the DVD image into several CDs.  
 # Missing milestones
   * We need to have a boot CD ready to test the KS.  This is not covered in other milestones.  Jason will create.
 # Dates
   * Some dates will need to be ajusted - will re-evaluate at the end of this week.  
 # Testers
   * Andy/Sowmya/Brian (plus others?) from ESnet
   * Who from UD?
   * Jason/Kavitha/Aaron + some others at Internet2 (our TSG group)
