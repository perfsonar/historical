#summary Current Roadmap for the perfSONAR

== Development Roadmap for perfSONAR Toolkit 3.5 (2015 release) ==

The following tasks are under consideration for release 3.5. These were discussed at the [http://meetings.internet2.edu/media/medialibrary/2014/04/08/20140408-perfSONAR-Roadmap-Internet2-Global-Summit.pdf Internet2 Global Summit]. Also see [https://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/issues/list?can=2&q=milestone=Release3.5 v3.5 issues] in the issue tracker. 

|| *Topic Area* || *Feature* || *Lead Org*|| *Description* ||
|| Impact || Auto-setup perfSONAR || ESnet || Add a auto-config tool that add the node to a existing mesh, or determines where to start testing too.  ||
|| Impact ||  Use-case specific bundles || TBD || toolkit alternatives, such as a user-level bundle that does not require root, a separate NDT/web100 bundle, Client-only bundle, DTN host bundle ||
|| Impact || $100 perfSONAR Nodes || TBD || Several projects are testing perfSONAR on low-cost hardware. Need to coordinate and integrate that work. ||
|| Usability || Improved NOC support || IU || improved nagios plugins ||
|| Usability ||  Improved data visualization || TBD || e.g. integration of traceroute data with owamp and bwctl, integrate some of the widgets from my.es.net ||
|| Usability ||  Improved support for network researchers || TBD || improved APIs and documentation, ability to request large chunks of data ||
|| Usability || Virtual organization GUI || TBD || GUI for mesh config tool ||
|| Usability ||  Web Interface Rewrite || IU || update to use modern layout library such as bootstrap ||
|| Efficiency || Improved release process || IU || automated RPM generation, add support for arm, and maybe debian  ||
|| Efficiency ||  BWCTL rewrite/enhancements || Internet2 || refactor code to make it easier to extend/add support for other tools ||
|| Advanced Networking || perfSONAR Support for SDN || TBD || TBD ||
|| Advanced Networking || NDT replacement || TBD || many NDT heuristics are not reliable on today's networks, and web100 is no longer supported. ||

== Development Roadmap for perfSONAR Toolkit 3.4 ==


  # perfSONAR node Cost Reduction: Supporting both latency testing and throughput testing on the same host will be a big win for many organizations. We plan to support this in the next release
  # Extensibility and Ease of Use: Adding REST APIs for all components will make it much easier for others to extend perfSONAR. This is a strong request from the community, and we will address this in the next release. The owamp MA will be rewritten to provide the ability to query for historical summaries of data.
  # Additional Troubleshooting Capabilities: These tasks include the top requests from users on how to get more value from the perfSONAR toolkit. This includes tool enhancements such as the ability to collect and store TCP retransmit information. Better data visualization tools are needed as well
  # Marketing/Communications/Documentation: Documentation needs an overhaul, and new marketing material targeted more at campus CIOs would be helpful
