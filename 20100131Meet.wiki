 # Attendees: 
   * TBD
 # LiveCD Topics (*Jason*, *Aaron*)
   * Remaining 3.1.X releases
     * Targeting 2 - 3 more this year.  May need to worry about some next year depending on support...
       * 3.1.3 in April (pre MM)
       * 3.1.4 in July (pre JTs)
       * 3.1.5 in Nov/Dec (if needed - hard with SC)
     * Critical bug fixes and software upgrades only
     * Will release faster if something *very* critical comes up
     * [http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2010/msg00010.html Debian security support for v. 4.0 (etch) is being EOL'ed on Feb 15th]
       * Upgrade?
       * Manually backport?
   * Support Structure
     * Need explicit language in a public area
     * Ex:
       * _We monitor X, Y, and Z for vulnderabilities_
       * _We are will support 3.1 releases through X date_
       * _We will make announcements on vulnerabilties within X days_
       * _We will have fixes available for vulnerabilities within X days_
     * SLAC Kernel Discussion
       * SLAC's policy: follow the RHEL kernels.  
       * Our (_unstated right now_) policy: Choose the [http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/10/11/235 long term support kernel] and follow the releases here.  
       * Setting a policy matters to the VOs (e.g. USATLAS).  Choosing a specific policy matters more to individual stake holders. We should weigh the options of following a packaged kernel linage vs what the support structure of the OSS community has to offer.  
   * RHEL (3.2) Transition
     * Targeting Summer for 3.2 Betas
     * Must support 3.1 in parallel
     * VOs may be slow to adopt 3.2 - they are still not recommending 3.1 to Tier3s for example.  
     * Features to worry about
       * Wizard interfaces
       * Backend magic to manage the disk
       * Upgrade path?
       * RPMs for all services and packages
       * Kernels (see above) - and if we want to support web100 long term
       * Install to disk option
 # TBD 1
 # TBD 2
 # TBD 3
