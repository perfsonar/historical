    * Andy - Nagios RSVP update working with BNL and other OSG people for Gratia. Looking at creating a bwctl/owamp MP. Comparing with EU versions.
    * Nils - nothing to update
    * Brian - nothing to add
    * Maxim - Issue 510. Added option for configurable timeout to keep old alarm semantics. Would like everyone to consider using wwwcurl in place of lwp for protocol transfers. Maxim will work on that. Also interested in adding project-level configuration managment functionality. Basically, the ability to have some amount of the configuration management to be taken from project-specific services.
    * Aaron - Circuit monitoring. Interacts with OSCARS, registers topo data, collects circuit ids/topology data and caching. Beginning to store measurement stats locally as well.
    * Joe - nothing to update
