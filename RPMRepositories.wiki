#summary A discussion of the ways to work with branches in the yum repository

== Creating A New Branch ==

 * Checkout https://cvs3.internet2.edu/svn/software/
 * Create a branch of trunk
 * Commit the branch
 * Create a new Internet2-repo RPM
  * Checkout https://svn.internet2.edu/svn/perfSONAR-PS/trunk/Internet2-repo/
  * Edit the spec file, and bump the release number
  * Edit the etc/Internet2.repo file and change the mirrorlist entry to point to your new branch:

before:
{{{
mirrorlist = http://software.internet2.edu/rpms/mirrors-Internet2
}}}
after:
{{{
baseurl    = http://software.internet2.edu/branches/aaron-testing/rpms/i386/main/
}}}

 * Build the RPM (make the tarball and build it with the spec), and commit it to the branch
  * The RPM *must* be signed, otherwise yum won't install it
 *  Kick someone at Internet2 to update the repository, or wait for a few hours, and it will get populated


== Adding RPMs To The Branch ==

 * Checkout your branch (e.g. https://cvs3.internet2.edu/svn/software/branches/aaron-testing)
 * Add your RPMs to the branch
  * The RPMs *must* be signed, otherwise yum won't install it
 * Commit your RPMs
 * Kick someone at Internet2 to update the repository, or wait for a few hours, and it will get populated


== Updating The Kickstart ==

 * Edit the kickstart, and replace the "mirrorlist" for the Internet2 repo with the baseurl for your branch

before:
{{{
repo --name=a-Internet2    --mirrorlist=http://software.internet2.edu/rpms/mirrors-Toolkit-Internet2
}}}
after:
{{{
repo --name=a-Internet2    --baseurl=http://software.internet2.edu/branches/aaron-testing/rpms/i386/main
}}}

 * It can also be helpful to make a couple other changes. In the %post section, there are two lines that can be uncommented so save the results of the %post to a file accessible after the installation.  
{{{
#(
        ...
#) 1> /root/post_install.log 2>&1
}}}

should be changed to 

{{{
(
 ...
 ) 1> /root/post_install.log 2>&1
}}}

Creating the Final Release:

If none of your users are going to try to update from the test release to the final release, do the following:

 * Merge the changed RPMs from the branch into trunk EXCEPT Internet2-repo
 * Commit the RPMs
 * Delete the branch
 * Kick someone at Internet2 to update the repository, or wait for a few hours, and it will get populated

If your users want to update from the test release to the final release, do the following:

 * Create a new Internet2-repo RPM with an updated version number (greater than the one in your repository). This RPM should point at the original location (i.e. *not* at your branch).
 * Upload that RPM to your branch, and commit it.
 * Upload that RPM to the trunk, and commit it.
 * Merge all the changed RPMs from your branch into the trunk
 * Commit the RPMs
 * Kick someone at Internet2 to update the repository, or wait for a few hours, and it will get populated
 * Wait until all your users have upgraded. They'll need to upgrade twice: Once to get the new Internet2-repo RPM pointing back at trunk, and once again to get any new RPMs from trunk.
 * Delete the branch
