#summary 2012 Development Idea Brainstorm.

= Customers, Core Constituents, Stakeholders =

Here is what I think the customers are, sorted in order of priority
  * ESnet/GRNOC staff
  * direct customers (eg: US labs and universities)
  * our customers collaborators (e.g.: sites in Europe and Asia)
  * the network research community
  * corporate users
  * VO organizations with membership of US labs and universities

Question... Who at these organizations? Decision makers? Network engineers? End users?

= Problems to Solve =

  * Difficult to manage multiple instances of a the toolkit.
    Benefactors:
    * Campuses that want to deploy several nodes around their infrastructure in a small geographical area (or in the case of a system like Penn State - around the entire state at satellite locations)
    * Regional networks that have several PoPs and want to station a performance node at each location
    * VOs that are comprised of multiple Campus/Lab facilities and spread perhaps world wide
    * Backbone networks that want to set up an observatory of their own (or in our case, if we want to freshen ours).
    Specific suggestions:
    * Way to export/import group of tests
    * Full-on gui for multiple-host management
  * Lookup Service Stability and Speed improvements
    Benefactors:
    * Entire infrastructure
    * Easier to create end-user tools
    * Lower deployment/help issues - users asking why their host is absent
    Specific Suggestions:
    * Rewrite proposal
  * Better analysis (guide user for "what now" question)
    Benefactors:
    * End users, campus/lab dept/division level network engineers
    * Potentially improved 'value proposition' for decision makers
    Specific Suggestions:
    * Something like NDT or Internet2 detective that makes use of historical data and highlights any 'problem' spots
    * TracerouteMA GUI
    * Integration of some of the e-center vis tool
    * customizable dashboard based on 'communities' (e.g: Atlas, 
Climage, etc...)
    * more flexible summarization model for owamp
  * Better reporting mechanism
    Benefactors:
    * Engineers/Decision makers - Labs/Univ/VOs
    Specific Suggestions:
    * full nagios integration
  * Encourage more end-user development work
    Benefactors:
    * Developers, Decision makers (show more value for investment)
    Specific Suggestions
    * App Store - collect the pS apps others have written in one place
    * Better documentation
    * Standards work? - definitive protocol would be nice
      * NML - does it matter?
      * GN2/pS-PS protocol differences
    * REST API
      * JSON data format?
    * Outreach/workshops
      * Developers
      * Users (engineers/decision makers?)
  * Better integration with Layer2 and below (including IDC and/or OF)
    Benefactors:
    * Network engineers for diagnosis
    * Decision makers if we can expose 'value' of L2 infrastructure
    Specific Suggestions:
    * Circuit Monitoring
    * OpenFlow - flow counters (per application/project etc...)
