== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees: 
   * Eric P, Joe, Jason, Brian, Marcos, Aaron, Andy, Inder, Martin
   * Apologies: Jeff
 # Teamp Updates
   * Eric P - Notes there will be a meeting with Martin/Eric/Marcos/Andy/Brian on gLS testing on 2/23.  
   * Joe - bwctld.limits file posted to stats1 based on the routing table.  Have a special DOE one as well.  
   * Jason - APAN slides for Jeff (will be available on psps.perfsonar soon).  Update web site(s).  Working with Google MLab on NDT stuff.  USAtlas debugging and release.  Working with other scientists (NEES/LSST) on performance needs, still very early.  Need to work with Andy on his 'client api' package.  
   * Brian - see Andy's update  
   * Marcos - gLS testing (similar to Andy's work), will start to coordiante with him.  
   * Aaron - working on porting tools to cisco platform
   * Andy - gLS testing
   * Inder - no
   * Martin - no
   * Jeff - Stuck in propsal land.  Wish him well.    
 # Actions from last call:
   * See [20100131Meet]
 # pSPT Release (Jason/Aaron)
   * Completed on Feb 17th
     * USATLAS is deploying, good feedback so far (people like what we did).  
     * No complaints (yet)
     * Tier3 doc will be worked on soon.  Shawn thinks this release may be stable enough for the Tier3s.  Will be careful to have USATLAS test the hardware instead of us doing it (Jason will keep the group posted).  
     * Jason/Brian/Joe talk a little about the SNMP topic that USATLAS brought up.  Joe/Brian talked with Shawn about this, and how its kind of complicated.  
   * Next release (3.1.3) proposed for April 9th or 16th (plenty of time for slip before SMM)
   * Content:
     * Jason will review bugs, wants to limit new development
     * Targeting critical fixes for the most part
     * There is a chance we won't need it (in case there are no critical vulner released.  
 # Results of gLS performance testing (Andy/Brian)
   * See [ESnetLSTesting]
   * Notes:
     * 
     * Showcase of work that andy and brian did in testing the gLS and hLS performance
     * Idea is to narrow down what is taking a long time
     * Where is the time being spend?  mostly in the database (not the web service).  Traffic doesn't seem to affect it much.  
     * Attempt to break down more
     * Netloggerized LS - checked into SVN.  
     * Going over the results + some discussion.  
   * General thoughts:
     * need more results
     * need to do things on _full_ hLSs  and gLSs (idea is that things take a long time because there is a lot of data to search)
     * Optimizing queries, both in the xmldb and at the user level (does nesting effect, etc).  
 # Next Face to Face Meeting - (if enough involvement)
   * April 24th (Sat) and April 25th (Sun) Before Spring Member Meeting in Washington DC
   * Pros:
     * Before the MM so we are all a bit more 'fresh' to talk about things
   * Cons:
     * May have to stay at hotels in DC and move to MM hotel
   * Notes:
     * Not a lot of support for the meeting on a weekend (hard for ESnet to get travel)
     * Can't go after due to IDC
     * Brian noted a 3 hour conference call once a month may fit the need of an entire day of face to face.  
 # Google Summer of Code
   * Applications from organizations due March 8th.
   * Internet2 would not be able to accept more than 2 students (and thats a stretch)
   * Is there interest in applying?  Would ESnet be able to absorb some mentoring duties if so?
   * Notes:
     * Joe doesn't see a lot of benefit for the cost.  Too much time spent on getting the projects off the ground, don't use in the end
     * Agreement all around.  
 # *Future topics*:
   * _*pSPS*_:
     * Community handling in regular testing screens.  If the user doesn't pick a community, others can'y use this mechanism to find the node
       * N.B. the node is still _findable_ via other methods including domain/IP and it does show up in the gLS
       * Does it make sense to set a default?
       * Should there be other methods to find sans communities?
     * GUIs
       * BWCTL
       * OWAMP
   * _*Google MLab*_
     * Register each deployment (and tools on each) into pSPS
     * GUI to find an NDT server.  Started by *Jason*, still have the _public_ vs _private_ routing to these servers
     * Make MLab data public - even better expose it via pSPS
   * _*NSF perfSONAR Workshop*_
     * How would a researcher use pS to fulfill research goals?
     * How do you get tool developers to publish via pS?
     * NSF will be creating a steering committee for this workshop.
     * Hopefully NSF is interested in funding pS.
   * _*Service Monitoring*_
     * Availability (current + historic)
     * Nagios Plugins
     * Data monitoring vs service liveness
   * _*Config management*_
     * Sharing service configuration through IS
     * Centralized way to manage configs of similar services.  
   * _*Status Collection Enhancements*_
     * Overview: DCN _Status_ page uses the TL1 collector to extract and display many of the Cienna counters.  Currently only cares about interfaces and interface-like things.  
     * Similar Work: Jon Dugan's [http://code.google.com/p/esxsnmp/|ESxSNMP] which is a high performance SNMP polling system.  
     * Enhancement Ideas
       * Combine efforts to use TL1 collectors in ESxSNMP.  Would use same database backend and pS interface by doing this
       * Collecting/Storing network topology.  Specifically: how interfaces are connected via the switching fabric/external links and any other tie ins to the discussions in working groups. 
       * Gathering and storing alarm information.  Is this the same as Status?  Could or should this be done in nagios.  
 
=== ACTIONS ===

  * _*ACTION*_: Marcos will communicate with Andy/Brian on the work he is doing with the gLS.  All parties shoudl work together on testing.
  * _*ACTION*_: Next meeting will be a topic meeting on gLS performance testing.
