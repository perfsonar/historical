== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees: 
   * TBD
 # Developer Updates
   * TBD
 # Actions from last call:
   * See [20100131Meet]
 # pSPT Release (Jason/Aaron)
   * Completed on Feb 17th
   * Next release (3.1.3) proposed for April 9th or 16th (plenty of time for slip before SMM)
   * Content:
     * Jason will review bugs, wants to limit new development
     * Targeting critical fixes for the most part
 # Results of gLS performance testing (Andy/Brian)
   * [ESnetLSTesting ]
 # Next Face to Face Meeting - (if enough involvement)
     * April 24th (Sat) and April 25th (Sun) Before Spring Member Meeting in Washington DC
     * Pros:
       * Before the MM so we are all a bit more 'fresh' to talk about things
     * Cons:
       * May have to stay at hotels in DC and move to MM hotel
 # Google Summer of Code
   * Applications from organizations due March 8th.
   * Internet2 would not be able to accept more than 2 students (and thats a stretch)
   * Is there interest in applying?  Would ESnet be able to absorb some mentoring duties if so?
 # *Future topics*:
   * _*pSPS*_:
     * Community handling in regular testing screens.  If the user doesn't pick a community, others can'y use this mechanism to find the node
       * N.B. the node is still _findable_ via other methods including domain/IP and it does show up in the gLS
       * Does it make sense to set a default?
       * Should there be other methods to find sans communities?
     * GUIs
       * BWCTL
       * OWAMP
   * _*Google MLab*_
     * Register each deployment (and tools on each) into pSPS
     * GUI to find an NDT server.  Started by *Jason*, still have the _public_ vs _private_ routing to these servers
     * Make MLab data public - even better expose it via pSPS
   * _*NSF perfSONAR Workshop*_
     * How would a researcher use pS to fulfill research goals?
     * How do you get tool developers to publish via pS?
     * NSF will be creating a steering committee for this workshop.
     * Hopefully NSF is interested in funding pS.
   * _*Service Monitoring*_
     * Availability (current + historic)
     * Nagios Plugins
     * Data monitoring vs service liveness
   * _*Config management*_
     * Sharing service configuration through IS
     * Centralized way to manage configs of similar services.  
   * _*Status Collection Enhancements*_
     * Overview: DCN _Status_ page uses the TL1 collector to extract and display many of the Cienna counters.  Currently only cares about interfaces and interface-like things.  
     * Similar Work: Jon Dugan's [http://code.google.com/p/esxsnmp/|ESxSNMP] which is a high performance SNMP polling system.  
     * Enhancement Ideas
       * Combine efforts to use TL1 collectors in ESxSNMP.  Would use same database backend and pS interface by doing this
       * Collecting/Storing network topology.  Specifically: how interfaces are connected via the switching fabric/external links and any other tie ins to the discussions in working groups. 
       * Gathering and storing alarm information.  Is this the same as Status?  Could or should this be done in nagios.
