== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees: Maxim, Yee, Jason, Aaron, Brian, Joe, Jeff
 # SVN issues
   * Merging branches (when? what?)
     * Aim for merging everything into the 'merge' branch the first week of Feb. Once that is done, the 'merge' branch will be brought back into 'trunk'.
 # Installation issues
   * common packaging
   * config files
     * Maxim is using CGI:Ajax and HTML:Template for his web-config application. Yee suggests looking at CGI:Application.
 # Testing
   * functional testing
     * Maxim is only supporting L3Endpoint because expanding the abstract type was tedious. Jason suggested trying MSV for the rnc->xsd expansion to support this.
   * wsdl
 # Documentation
   * Public Announcement
     * Jeff asked that everyone review the 'overview' pS-PS content document and add portions they are responsible for. This will be given to the PR arm of Internet2 and a more polished version will be sent back for us to approve.
   * Product docs (pingER doc status, pSB status)
 # MDM Release Mgmt Update
   * Who wants to be on the call tomorrow?
     *  Jeff, Maxim, Yee all plan to.
 # pS-PS developers meeting @ HI
   * Still have it? Perhaps we should plan for something post Jt Techs?
     * This has been postponed. Probably until late February or March. (Once all the MDM services are ready, so everyone can focus on this. Jeff will bring this up again in February for discussion.
