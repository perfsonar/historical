#     This is a sample script to show how status information about a given link
#     should be output. It simply randomly selects a state based on the
#     type of status being checked.
#
#     The first paramter will always exist and will be the type of status being
#     looked up: 'admin' or 'oper'
#
#     A real script might consult an SNMP MA or consult the router via the CLI
#
#     The script should output something like:
#
#     timestamp,[state]
