This files in this directory provide a skeleton MA that can be modified to
create new MAs. In the files, there are comments marked with an "XXX" that
denote where you may need to be modify when creating new MAs.

There are 2 files in the directory that must be modified and one that can be
modified but is not required to create an MA.

  skeleton.pl - This is the driver for the MA and handles many of the tasks
  related to instantiation of the MA and the launching of new processes to
  handle incoming requests. The modifications to this file should be minimal,
  mainly replacing instances of the word 'skeleton' or 'Skeleton' with an
  appropriate name.

  Skeleton.pm - This file will contain the bulk of your new MA. The
  changes/additions to this file will be major due to the differing nature of
  the various MAs that one may want to create. Like the skeleton.pl file, all
  references to "skeleton" or "Skeleton" will need to be replaced with
  appropriate names. Beyond that, the scope of the rest of the changes depend
  heavily on what the role of the MA is. A given MA may change default
  configuration options, the set of namespaces used, the message handling or
  the event type handling.

  configure.pl - This file is optional as its job is to create the
  configuration file to be used by your MA. Its purpose is to ask people simple
  questions and create the configuration file for the MA. As before, references
  to "Skeleton" or "skeleton" should be changed appropriately. However, new
  questions should be added to ask the user about other configuration options
  available.

Once you have modified these files, simply, rename skeleton.pl and Skeleton.pm
appropriately and copy the file formely known as Skeleton.pm to
"../../lib/perfSONAR_PS/MA". You should then be able to execute the skeleton.pl
and it should startup your service.
