Installation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - HTML files and directory of images must be in a web directory.  The helper
   scripts will generate JSON and CGI files into that directory.  Either run the
   script in place or modify it to spit CGIs and JSONs into the proper location.
   Dir should be EXEC enabled for CGI scripts.  

 - Run the helper scripts in the background, e.g. './SC09-graph-cgi.pl &' and
   './SC09-perfOMeter.pl &'
 
 - Scripts have error handling, but may choke on some bad data.  Watch to be sure
   they don't die.  
   
Configuration:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - All interfaces are hardcoded in scripts
 
 - All perfOMeters and graphs are hardcoded as well, and match what is in the
   scripts. 
 
 - Changing/Adding is all manual

Caveats:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Changing/Adding is all manual, see above.  
 
 - Libraries are absolute.  Will need some pS-PS libs on the target system.  
 
 - Watch the script to be sure it doesn't die

TODO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Package for release
 - Error handling/logging
 - Configuration file based
 - CSS improvements
