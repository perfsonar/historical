Installation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - HTML file and directory of files must be in a web directory.  The helper
   script in 'dashboard_files' will generate JSON files into that directory.
   Either run the script in place or modify it to spit CGIs into the proper
   location.

 - Run the helper script in the background, e.g. 
   'dashboard_files/./Internet2-perfOMeter.pl &'
 
 - Script has error handling, but may choke on some bad data.  Watch to be sure
   it doesnt die.  
   
Configuration:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - All interfaces are hardcoded in dashboard_files/Internet2-perfOMeter.pl
 
 - All perfOMeters in dashboard_files are related to the interfaces in
   dashboard_files/Internet2-perfOMeter.pl
 
 - Changing/Adding is all manual

Caveats:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Changing/Adding is all manual, see above.  
 
 - Libraries are absolute.  Will need some pS-PS libs on the target system.  
 
 - Watch the script to be sure it doesn't die

TODO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Package for release
 - Error handling/logging
 - Configuration file based
