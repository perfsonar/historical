Installation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - HTML file must be in a web directory.  The helper script will generate CGI
   files into the CWD.  Either run the script from the same dir as the HTML file
   or modify it to spit CGIs into the proper location. Dir sould have EXEC privs
   for the CGIs.

 - Run the helper script in the background, e.g. './Internet2-graphs.pl &'
 
 - Script has error handling, but may choke on some bad data.  Watch to be sure
   it doesnt die.  
   
Configuration:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - All interfaces are hardcoded in Internet2-graphs.pl
 
 - All graphs in observatory.html related to the interfaces in
   Internet2-graphs.pl
 
 - Changing/Adding is all manual

Caveats:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Changing/Adding is all manual, see above.  
 
 - Libraries are absolute.  Will need some pS-PS libs on the target system.  
 
 - Watch the script to be sure it doesn't die

TODO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Package for release
 - Error handling/logging
 - Configuration file based
 - CSS/Images
