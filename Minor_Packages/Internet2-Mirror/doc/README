The perfSONAR-PS project has two software repositories to support the pS
Performance Toolkit:

  - Kernel Packages
  - Supporting software
 
The included shell scripts can be used to mirror these repositories in alternate
locations.  After a mirror has been set up, inform the perfSONAR-PS development
effort of the location by sending an email to "i2-perfsonar@interent2.edu".
