Overview
--------

multi-ethtool is a script that allows you to change multiple ethernet
parameters via standard service calls.  The only supported interfaces for
changing these parameters at startup are by setting ETHTOOL_OPTS in the
ifcfg-ethX, which will get honored in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-eth
(though that is limited to a single ethtool invocation), or via udev rules,
which does allow multiple options to be set, though these will be applied only
at boot, and cannot change dynamically or on demand.

The intent of this script is to be called by other services that require extra
ethernet settings.

Using multi-ethtool
-----------

To start multi-ethtool you can start the service with the service command:

   service multi-ethtool start

If you want to enable the service in the system, use the chkconfig command:

   chkconfig multi-ethtool on

Please have a look at /etc/sysconfig/multi-ethtool for tuning parameters.
