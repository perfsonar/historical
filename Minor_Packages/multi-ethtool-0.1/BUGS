- when changing parameters on the same interface which is being used to access
  a running system (e.g. when logged in remotely via SSH), the connection will
  stall while the new parameters take effect; therefore, it may be preferable
  to chkconfig this service on and then restart.  This behavior may be
  negligble for web clients, but this has not been tested.
