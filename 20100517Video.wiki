 # Discussion of how to filter owamp data (Brian)
   * The current owamp plots shows lots of large spikes that are due to network activity on the host, not due to actual network latency. We need a way to filter this out.
   * My proposed solution: modify delayGraph.cgi to compute the 95th percentile (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile)  and the median of the data returned, and not show any value above
the 95th percentile (or optionally replace all values > than the 95th percentile with the median value) when generating the graph
   * Future enhancements to this solution should include:
       * write a client API where various types of filtering are built into the API
       * store a daily? histogram and the median in the database, so that they can be queried, and not recomputed every time (or maybe a running histogram of the last 7 days?)
   * Q: Who should do this?
