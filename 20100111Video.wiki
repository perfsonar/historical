 # Future meetings

   * F2F
 # RPM Building
   * Current:
     * Supported Platforms
       * i386 and x86_64
       * RHEL/CentOS/Scientific + older (pre 8/9?) Fedora (Newer FCs too bleeding edge?)
       * Nothing for Debian based
     * Build Environment
       * Varies by developer, e.g. Jason builds on VMs on laptop: Centos 4 i386 and x86_64.  
     * Test Environment
       * Also varies by developer, Jason uses VMs on laptop: e.g. Centos 3/4/5, Fedora 9/10, Scientific 4/5 - both i386 and x86_64.  
   * Proposed:
     * Need to make a stand on what we are supporting and what we will not support (post this publically).
     * If we are supporting more, RPM Repo organization should change (e.g. others build test on each arch/platform and have a seperate repo for each instead of a _catch all_, see here: http://rpmfusion.org/)
     * Need a build/test farm so this doesn't fall on individual developers anymore.  This can be done on the cheap with a single machine and dedicated VMs.  
 # Topic 3
 # *Future topics*:
   * _*pSPS*_:
     * Community handling in regular testing screens.  If the user doesn't pick a community, others can'y use this mechanism to find the node
       * N.B. the node is still _findable_ via other methods including domain/IP and it does show up in the gLS
       * Does it make sense to set a default?
       * Should there be other methods to find sans communities?
     * GUIs
       * BWCTL
       * OWAMP
   * _*Google MLab*_
     * Register each deployment (and tools on each) into pSPS
     * GUI to find an NDT server.  Started by *Jason*, still have the _public_ vs _private_ routing to these servers
     * Make MLab data public - even better expose it via pSPS
   * _*NSF perfSONAR Workshop*_
     * How would a researcher use pS to fulfill research goals?
     * How do you get tool developers to publish via pS?
     * NSF will be creating a steering committee for this workshop.
     * Hopefully NSF is interested in funding pS.
   * _*Service Monitoring*_
     * Availability (current + historic)
     * Nagios Plugins
     * Data monitoring vs service liveness
   * _*Config management*_
     * Sharing service configuration through IS
     * Centralized way to manage configs of similar services.  
   * _*Status Collection Enhancements*_
     * Overview: DCN _Status_ page uses the TL1 collector to extract and display many of the Cienna counters.  Currently only cares about interfaces and interface-like things.  
     * Similar Work: Jon Dugan's [http://code.google.com/p/esxsnmp/|ESxSNMP] which is a high performance SNMP polling system.  
     * Enhancement Ideas
       * Combine efforts to use TL1 collectors in ESxSNMP.  Would use same database backend and pS interface by doing this
       * Collecting/Storing network topology.  Specifically: how interfaces are connected via the switching fabric/external links and any other tie ins to the discussions in working groups. 
       * Gathering and storing alarm information.  Is this the same as Status?  Could or should this be done in nagios.
