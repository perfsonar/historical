 # SC recap
   # How did weathermap work? Is there usable code here for other projects? Can we make it more plug-n-play for the future?
 # Deployments page - changes still needed?
 # KOI UDP performance issue - status?
 # Central configuration service
   * Need to talk about how to harmonize service configuration files in functionality and syntax. And how that effects centralized configuration.
 # ISO - Functional Specification
   * Attempt to make sure functionality is clear from a user perspective, and to ensure that the disc is useful from a diagnostic perspective as well as a measurement-point perspective.
 # Discussion of middle-term goals
   * Release management
   * It has been proposed that after SC, we shore up a very few pieces of missing functionality, and then concentrate on hardening and optimizing the software we have.
   * If that is the general sentiment, perhaps we can come up with the specific short list of functionality we want to deal with - and come up with ideas on what reasonable processes we can go through to harden/optimize.
 # Next meeting will be ??? Dec 1, 2:30 pm Eastern Time
