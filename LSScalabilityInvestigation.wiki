== Current Issues to Investigate in gLS/hLS Services ==

 *  Unknown scalability limits
 *  Unknown data consistency
 *  Failure modes are obscure and hard to debug
 *  Sometimes hLS registers empty summary data
 *  Possible XMLDB locking issues
 *  Behavior when using different values in configuration key "`ls_registration_interval`"
 *  Behavior when using different values in configuration key "`maintenance_interval`"


== Suggested tests ==

 *  Use `ls_registration_daemon` to temporarily register 'fake services'.  Jason has a service emulator [http://anonsvn.internet2.edu/svn/perfSONAR-PS/trunk/client/fakeService/ FakeService] that should help.
 *  Set up a test gLS and hLS, and then play with Jason's "!FakeService" tool to see when and how things break.
 *  Query the gLS and verify that everything what was registered is returned in the query. 
 *  Deploy the !FakeService on 50 ESnet hosts and see what happens.


== Testbed ==

 *  University of Delaware's Distributed and Meta-Systems Lab (DAMSL) will participate with 3 servers:
  *  _ale_.damsl.cis.udel.edu
  *  _moonshine_.damsl.cis.udel.edu
  *  _stout_.damsl.cis.udel.edu

 *  Create a new gLS 'cloud', i.e., a new hints file.  The current hints file is located at http://dc211.internet2.edu/gls.root.hints .  Make a new hints file like this that includes the gLS instances created for this testing, and place it on _stout_'s web server (/var/www/external).  The contents of the file will be:

{{{
  http://ale.damsl.cis.udel.edu:9990/perfSONAR_PS/services/gLS
}}}

 *  Install the !LookupService package:
  *  one gLS in _ale_, port 9990:  in the daemon.conf set '`root 1`'.
  *  one hLS in _moonshine_, standard port:  in the daemon.conf set '`root 0`'.

 *  After initial setup and testing:
  *  Install a total of 2 - 3 gLSs:  one at UDel, one at LBL, one somewhere else (could be UDel/LBL, or one in Ann Arbor).
  *  Install at least 3 hLS and probably more.
  *  Coordinate deployment of !FakeService on ESnet hosts on additional LSs.

=== Preparing _ale_ ===

This server _ale_ is Fedora Core release 4 (Stentz).

Checked out perfSONAR repository into home directory (must have permission):

 `svn co https://svn.internet2.edu/svn/perfSONAR-PS/`

In perfSONAR-PS/branches/RELEASE_3.1/perfSONAR_PS-!LookupService, must now run
 
{{{
cd perfSONAR-PS/branches/RELEASE_3.1/perfSONAR_PS-LookupService
sudo make install
cd scripts
sudo ./install_dependencies.sh
sudo ./install_dependencies.sh
}}}

After `sudo ./install_dependencies.sh` command, got the following error message:

{{{
running xml2-config...failed
The installed version of libxml2 not compatible with XML::LibXML.

You may continue at your own risk, but:

  - don't expect XML::LibXML to build or work correctly!
  - don't report errors!
  - don't send patches!

Check the README file for more information on versions
that are tested with XML::LibXML

  PAJAS/XML-LibXML-1.69.tar.gz
  /usr/local/bin/perl Makefile.PL -- NO Makefile created
Running make test
  Make had some problems, won't test
Running make install
  Make had some problems, won't install
}}}

This suggests problems with the current version of `libxml2` installed on _ale_.

The next installation command, `sudo ./install_dependencies.sh`, does not report anything, which is suspicious and corroborates that the environment must not be healthy.

Trying to start the Lookup Service (`sudo /etc/init.d/lookup_service start`) yields the following error.

Clearly, `libxml2` must be updated on _ale_ prior to installing the LS service.

Trying now to update libxml2 using the _yum_ tool for Fedora:

 `sudo yum update libxml2`

Here's the new error.

}}}

The _yum_ tool failed, probably due to a missing `repomd.xml` file (as hinted by the error message), or because there are insufficient mirror sites listed somewhere.  Now, we need to find out how to fix this by surveying _yum_ sites.

From the error message, the URL used to access the file `repomd.xml` seems weird (192.168.0.1, which is a local address).

The directory `/etc/yum.repos.d` contains the configuration files _yum_ uses to access mirror sites for repositories.  The listing is:

{{{
fedora-devel.repo         fedora.repo                  vlc-contrib.repo
fedora-extras-devel.repo  fedora-updates.repo          vlc.repo
fedora-extras.repo        fedora-updates-testing.repo
}}}

Several of these files contain a reference to the address 192.168.0.1, such as the file `fedora-extras.repo`:

{{{
[extras]
name=Fedora Extras $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=http://192.168.0.1/yum/$releasever/extras/$basearch/
#mirrorlist=http://fedora.redhat.com/download/mirrors/fedora-extras-$releasever

gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora-extras

}}}

Searching for information on https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Yum, as of August 20, 2009, at 20:29h EDT (8:29pm EDT), we are welcomed with an empty page with *Yum* written as title.

Searching a bit more aggressively yields the page https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Extras/Mirrors, where several mirror sites are listed for the _extras_ files.  Now, we need to find mirrors for the other files.

More research produces the URL http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/extras/.  But the subdirectory for Fedora 4 is no longer available under this address.  A README file in this location states that this Fedora version is not maintained (since the current version is Fedora 11).  `libxml2` has to be updated manually.  Turned to http://xmlsoft.org/ for more details on how to do this.

Downloaded the following files in attempt to update libxml2:

 `libxml2-2.7.3-1.x86_64.rpm`

 `libxml2-devel-2.7.3-1.x86_64.rpm`
 
Running a check before attempting any update:

 `rpm -F --test libxml2-2.7.3-1.x86_64.rpm`
 
We get the dependency errors:
