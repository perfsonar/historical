#summary Standard Operating Procedures for Maintaining perfSONAR Global Infrastructure

*DRAFT*

= Introduction =

PerfSONAR is a distributed infrastructure.  It is important that each domain
maintains complete autonomy in how they manage their local infrastructure.
However, some components of the infrastructure directly support the global
community, and must be held up to a base line standard.  T

The perfSONAR Lookup service is a global distributed infrastructure. The Global Lookup
Services (GLS services) are important for the proper functioning of the entire infrastructure.

= Expectations =
The perfSONAR collaboration expects domains hosting GLS services to meet a set of
minimal standards to include the service in the set of root GLS servers.

  * The GLS service is a production 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year service.  
  * The hardware supporting the service will be maintained in a production like manner.
  * Changes to the GLS infrastructure will be managed using light-weight change management procedures.
  * Servers that are not meeting expectations will be removed from the list of production GLS servers.


= Standard Operating Procedures =

==  Hardware ==

  * Regular planned Maintenance should be announced to (insert mailing list here) at least 48 hours in advance.
  * Unplanned or emergency maintenance should be announced as soon as possible.


== Software ==

  * The GLS should run a version of the gLS code that has been discussed on (insert mailer here).
  * Changes to the gLS service should be manged using a change management procedure.
    * document that here :-)
