 # Attendees:

   * Andy/Brian
   * Marcos
   * Ahmed
 # pSPT 3.1.3 Release
   * Andy commited alterations to the open/close procedure
   * Seeing a large amount of database 'lock' errors at Internet2 (ndb1 GLS)
     * Related to dbxml?
     * Related to recent fixes?
   * Issue notes:
     * DB must be locked at certain points in operation, normal when _writing_:
       * Cleaning
       * Registration/Deregistration/Keepalive
       * Summarization
     * DB errors occur when these overlap.
     * Critical sections (e.g. when we are actually _writing_) are kept as small as possible to mitigate the errors
     * _Read_ operations (Query) can overlap with _writes_.  
     * Literature at the time of development (2007) suggested that DB _connection_ (like a _handle_ in SQL terms) must be opened new with each thread/process that attaches to database.  
     * Transaction management is a combination of the library and perfSONAR-PS try/catches to ensure concurrency
