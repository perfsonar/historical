 # Attendees: 
 # gLS Testing Update
   * Andy/Brian
   * Marcos
   * Ahmed
 # pSPT 3.1.3 Release
   * Andy commited alterations to the open/close procedure
   * Seeing a large amount of database 'lock' errors at Internet2 (ndb1 GLS)
     * Related to dbxml?
     * Related to recent fixes?
   * _Testing_ gLS set up on a different machine at Internet2 (DC):
     * Loaded into the main _gLS cloud_
     * [http://dcn-ls.internet2.edu/view.cgi?hls=http://dc213.internet2.edu:9991/perfSONAR_PS/services/gLS]
     * Using dbxml 2.5.16
     * Logging set to _normal_ for now.  Will enable netlogging/debug mode if required
   * Issue notes:
     * DB must be locked at certain points in operation, normal when _writing_:
       * Cleaning (_read_, CPU, _write_)
       * Registration/Deregistration/Keepalive of hLSs (CPU, _read_, _write_)
       * Summarization (_read_, CPU, _write_)
       * Syncing with other gLSs (_read_, CPU) 
     * DB errors occur when these overlap.
     * Critical sections (e.g. when we are actually _writing_) are kept as small as possible to mitigate the errors
     * _Read_ operations (Query) can overlap with _writes_.  
     * Literature at the time of development (2007) suggested that DB _connection_ (like a _handle_ in SQL terms) must be opened new with each thread/process that attaches to database.  
     * Transaction management is a combination of the library and perfSONAR-PS try/catches to ensure concurrency
