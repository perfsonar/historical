== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees
 # Team Updates
 # Coordination of short term GUI development
 # What should the ISO do with data longer term? (Requested by Brian)
 # ESnet OpenDevNet status update
 # How to best use Issue tracker for "current work" that is not yet mapped to any specific release
 # Terena conference submission?
 # Future topics:
   * Google MLab
     * It would be great if we could start registering all these nodes in pS.
     * LS archive for finding an NDT server. How do you know what things are available 'publicly' or not.
     * Pushing to make the MLab data available. It would be great if we could provide a pS interface for them.
   * NSF request to fund a workshop for perfSONAR.
     * How would a researcher use pS to fulfill research goals?
     * How do you get tool developers to publish via pS?
     * NSF will be creating a steering committee for this workshop.
     * Hopefully NSF is interested in funding pS.
   * Service Monitoring and Config management
     * gLS 'monitoring'
  * Status collection for low-level device PMs
    The DCN status page that was put together for the monitoring is a relatively simple collector that grabs various performance counters and other data about elements on the Cienas. Right now, it confines itself to things that look like interfaces. There's a similar project that Jon Dugan has been working on for ESnet called ESxSNMP that grabs performance counters for SNMP hosts. It would be good to have a discussion about how these two monitoring infrastructures might work together. At minimum, it might be feasible to get the TL1 monitoring components to use the same metadata database and counter databases, and, implicitly, perfsonar interface.

    Another possible area of discussion include how the monitoring above can be extended to support collection and storage of topological information. The topology information could include how interfaces are connected together internally in the switch/router (via cross-connects, adaptation or whatever). It might also be good to think about how to collect information about how switches/routers are wired together.
    = =
    It'd be feasible to grab and store TL1/SNMP alarms as part of the collection framework. Though, that might be more reasonably done via nagios plugins.
    = =
    Currently in the regular testing setup screen, if a user doesn't specify a 'community', the node can not be found. We need to figure out a way to 'find' these nodes. Is there a reasonable way to 'find' them? (Perhaps if there is no 'community' specificied, it should get a 'default' of some kind?)
