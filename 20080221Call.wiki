== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees: Jason, Yee, Jared, Brian, Aaron, Maxim
 # Team Updates
   # SLAC
     * Jared: Finished constructing (module based) test suite for PingER. All code for MP/MA passes. Packaging nearly completed. Need to decide if the conf tools (i.e. webadmin) should belong in the CPAN package.
     * Yee: Finished MP issues, awaiting packaging and the move to new SVN structure. Would like to move gmaps code (would like code review) into new svn structure.
   # IU
     * N/A
   # UDEL
     * N/A
   # ESnet
     * Brian: Working on test suite with Aaron/Jason currently, others soon. More updates on this below...
   # Internet2
     * Aaron: Implemented changes into daemon to handle the filtering. Proof of concept with Status/SNMP MAs (requires further testing to declare victory). Changed several functions in the process to the new parameters API. Will need to change others as well. Need to upgrade skeleton to go with new changes
     * Jason: At NPW last week, good turnout and participation from NOAA/OU. OU would be interested in installing perfSONAR sometime in the future (check back around summer JTs). Aiding Brian with testing of SNMP MA. Need to fix LS to account for some performance issues. Will address SNMP MA performance/functionality this week. Working on documentation for deadline of Croatian pS Dev meeting.
   # Fermilab
     * Maxim: On leave last week, was locked out of systems. Still catching up with e-mail on issues including chaining. Looking for feedback on webadmin (Jason and MM from Greece only two to comment so far). Will webadmin be in the CPAN packages? All: Don't know yet. How do we want to do configuration for other services, CPAN based or webadmin? Nearly done with functional testing for MDM. Notify when svn is being moved.
   # Georgia Tech
     * N/A
 # SVN issues
   * Merging branches update
     * Waiting on PingER release for official move.
       * Estimated Start/End Time
         * end of this week, beginning of next week (Yee, Maxim, Jared) to notify when ready). Should require single day of freeze + code modifications to ensure everything works.
       * What is included/what isn't (policy on deleted branches)
         * All old branches (no activity in months) need to go. New policy to keep branches up to date and merge/delete regularly.
       * Changes to proposed structure (i.e. where will examples, testing, documentation fit?)
         * Need spot for testing, documentation, clients, example messages (i.e. do we package example messages with the services for CPAN?)
 # Testing
   * Test suite
     * Brian is leading the effort with help from service developers (Aaron/Jason currently, will be asking Maxim/Yee for assistance after initial work). The starting point will be the SNMP MA. Plan is to auto-generate store file + rrds then send series of messages to test both performance and correctness. Will generalize framework to all services after this stage. Will require request/response messages from each service writer (look in doc). May generalize this framework to SOAP-UI or module based tests as well. Yee has asked for SQLite extensions (to follow rrd pattern) for PingER.
 # Documentation
   * Updates
     * Must be complete for Croatian meeting.
 # Next call will be 25 Feb 2008
