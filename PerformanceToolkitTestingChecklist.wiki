<wiki:toc max_depth="6" />

== Introduction ==

This page contains a checklist of things to test, and questions to answer, before releasing a Performance Toolkit.  It can be submitted as a bug report in the event of difficulties

== Identifying Information ==
  * Tester (Name, Email):
  * Test Date (Date):
  * Version Tested (x.y.z):
  * Software Type (Live CD or Netinstall):
  * Machine Type (VM e.g. VMWare, 1G Memory or Server Make/Model, e.g. Dell 1950):
  * Architecture (x86 or x86_64):
  * Testing Type (Upgrade from a.b.c or Clean Install): 

== Download and Installation Questions ==
  * `_____` Did the provided MD5 Sum Verify against the download?
  * `_____` Were any errors seen during OS Boot/Installation?  

=== New Installation ===
  * `_____` Could you log in as root on the console with a blank password?
