All of the relevant logs for perfSONAR services are located in '/var/log/perfsonar'.  The following is a mapping between services and the logs the create:

 * MySQL database maintenance scripts:
   * /var/log/perfsonar/cleanupdb_bwctl.log
   * /var/log/perfsonar/cleanupdb_owamp.log
   * /var/log/perfsonar/cleanupdb_traceroute.log
 * The config daemon is what lets the Web UI write to the various config files when a change is made (e.g. to the administrative info, or a regular test):
   * /var/log/perfsonar/config_daemon.log

   * /var/log/perfsonar/discover_external_address.log
 * The LS cache is a downloaded set of services registered to the lookup service, this log relates to the process of downloading:
