== Architecture == 

The architecture of the _perfSONAR_ *LS* has taken on two design through its use.  
Originally planned as a centralized service, the *LS* would accept registrations and 
manage the data for all services in a _perfSONAR_ framework.  This paradigm would 
not scale to the multi-domain operation that was always assumed for the tools of 
_perfSONAR_ forcing the introduction of a _Global Lookup Service_ (*gLS*).  This 
new architecture allows for global discovery with minimal modifications to the
original design.

=== Current === 

The following illustrates the current LS architecture from the point of view of 
both _perfSONAR_ and _DCN_ services.

The centralized design has two clear benefits:

 # All services know the location of the *LS*
 # Information is guaranteed to be there if it is present in the framework
 
The downsides however are very prohibitive:

 # No redundancy
 # Performance bottleneck
 # Does not scale to the cases where individuals would like to _run their own_

The legacy *LS* is still available and supported as a product in the _perfSONAR_ 
framework, but all effort regarding this information service has been refocused 
to the *gLS*.

=== Proposed === 

The *gLS* architecture is similar to that of the *LS* where individual services
still maintain the information of registered services and respond to queries.  The major 
difference is the existence of an _upper layer_ of *gLS* instances that propagate 
summary information of each _lower level_ Home Lookup Service (*hLS*) into what
has been termed the _*gLS* cloud_.  This cloud enables global discovery: the phase 
where before finding exactly what you want (e.g. data for idc.internet2.edu), you first 
find where it may live (e.g. the *hLS* for internet2.edu).

An example of the architecture follows.
