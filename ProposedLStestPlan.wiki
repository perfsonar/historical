# This page contains information on plans for testing the gLS/hLS

= Introduction =

The Lookup Service is a critical piece of the perfSONAR infrastructure, and it is important to verify that
the performance scales in all dimensions, including number of clients, number of hLS's, and amount of data being registered in each hLS. 

This page describes a test plan to be performed on the ESnet OpenDevNet. OpenDevNet will all mutiple VMs to be used to simulate a reasonably large test environment.

= Basic hLS Testing =

Determine the amount of time for each of the following:


== Notes ==
Complete testing must involve the ability to modify each of the following independently:
 * the gLS to gLS synchronization update rate
 * the hLS to gLS synchronization update rate
 * the MA to hLS update rate
 * the number of MAs
 * the number of gLS's
 * the number of (src/dest/eventTypes) in an MA

== Test Assumptions  ===
 * each MA registers with 2 hLS's for redundancy
 * each 'network domain' runs 2 gLS's for redundancy
 * number of MA's should scale to around 100 per gLS
 * number of gLS's should scale to around 100  
 * the synchronization rate should tested at the following intervals: 
   ** 10,30,60 min updates

The following should be measured for each test configuration:
 * Query time for a single requests
 * Query time for simultaneous requests (5, 10, 50) to a single gLS
 * measure the change in query time when a hLS or gLS fails
