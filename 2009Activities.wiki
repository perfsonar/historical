Have been unable to duplicate. Working primarily on eCenter. Looking at ways to do remote administration of pS services on hosts. Need to work on functional and design specifications.   * Ezra: Testing emulab architure (virtual switches), testing ciruit monitoring. Currently working on making sure emulab images have the same pS versions installed. Ezra is interested in Deb packages of pS.   * Aaron: Iperf3 integration into bwctl. Prliminary version working. Working on NTP security patch.   * Eric: Nothing to report.   * Andy: USAtlas found processes showing processes running when they are not. Has a patch ready for testing. Working on adding value buckets into owamp MA. Database interaction of MA is slow.   * Jeff: Roadmap, OSG report, Training/Workshops in the future.   * Joe: LHCOPN report. Monitoring tutorial. Map of LHCOPN (graphical e2emon system). Seemed to be discontent from regionals. For circuit monitoring - (good, good, unknown, good) == good? Don't like that model. DEISA has rejected MDM because it is not multi-domain, they also do not like the GPS clock req.   * Brian: Nothing to report   * Martin: Nothing to report   * Marcos: Put out more results from gLS testing. Please look at the wiki page. # Actions from last call:   * _*ACTION*_: Everyone - please provide feedback on cfengine config.   * _*ACTION*_: Maxim will work with Andy and Aaron to verify the pingER-MP fix.   * _*ACTION*_: Andy will propose methods to deal with test point uniqueness.   * _*ACTION*_: Jeff, Brian and Joe will work on the roadmap.   * _*ACTION*_: Jon will add Aaron to Iperf project. Aaron will add autoconf tools and begin bwctl/iperf3 integration.   * _*ACTION*_: Joe/Brian will consider if ESnet has resources they want to put towards the RedHat based pS-NPTk version. # pS-Performance-Toolkit - Security updates   * NTP issue     * *plan is to include a fix in the 3.1.2 release. Already have a script available that will dynamically upgrade a 3.1 and 3.1.1 host whenever it is rebooted.*   * Policy for security updates going forward     # Need a more private list for discussion of issues     # Publicly announce once we have solution?     # Automatic security updates? # *!TestPoint Uniqueness* (Andy)     * Andy discovered two separate types of duplicates that might appear in serviceTest.cgi. In one case, there were two separate entries that returned the same data set, and in the other, there were two identical looking entries that returned different data. Andy thought that the former problem might be a problem in the pSB MA's SQL generation where requests for two different 'node' elements were getting mapped to only one of them. To handle the latter issue, Andy thought that he could modify the service test CGI script to merge the duplicate entries into a single element that requests multiple keys and overlays both sets of data onto the same plot. There was some discussion about how this might get rearchitected, but it was decided that these kinds of ideas would probably be more appropriate for a future "MA database architecture" meeting. Jeff and Aaron thought that Andy's short term approach seemed sound. # Future Meetings     * Suggested Topics:        * MA database architecture        * gLS/hLS profiling/optimizations        * Automated updates for pS-PerfTK        * Circuit Monitoring        * Architecture for web-services based test scheduling        * Nagios on the toolkit   * 1/2 day vid-conf in January   * 1/2 day f2f @ SLC (Jt Techs - Sunday afternoon) # *Future topics*:   * _*pSPS*_:     * Community handling in regular testing screens.  If the user doesn't pick a community, others can'y use this mechanism to find the node       * N.B. the node is still _findable_ via other methods including domain/IP and it does show up in the gLS       * Does it make sense to set a default?       * Should there be other methods to find sans communities?     * GUIs       * BWCTL       * OWAMP   * _*Google MLab*_     * Register each deployment (and tools on each) into pSPS     * GUI to find an NDT server.  Started by *Jason*, still have the _public_ vs _private_ routing to these servers     * Make MLab data public - even better expose it via pSPS   * _*NSF perfSONAR Workshop*_     * How would a researcher use pS to fulfill research goals?     * How do you get tool developers to publish via pS?     * NSF will be creating a steering committee for this workshop.     * Hopefully NSF is interested in funding pS.   * _*Service Monitoring*_     * Availability (current + historic)     * Nagios Plugins     * Data monitoring vs service liveness   * _*Config management*_     * Sharing service configuration through IS     * Centralized way to manage configs of similar services.     * _*Status Collection Enhancements*_     * Overview: DCN _Status_ page uses the TL1 collector to extract and display many of the Cienna counters.  Currently only cares about interfaces and interface-like things.       * Similar Work: Jon Dugan's [http://code.google.com/p/esxsnmp/|ESxSNMP] which is a high performance SNMP polling system.       * Enhancement Ideas       * Combine efforts to use TL1 collectors in ESxSNMP.  Would use same database backend and pS interface by doing this       * Collecting/Storing network topology.  Specifically: how interfaces are connected via the switching fabric/external links and any other tie ins to the discussions in working groups.        * Gathering and storing alarm information.  Is this the same as Status?  Could or should this be done in nagios.  === 20091130Video ======= Agenda/Minutes ==== # Attendees: Ezra, Martin, Aaron, Andy, Eric, Fahad, Brian, Marcos, Maxim, Jeff, Joe # Developer Updates   * Aaron - Iperf3 integration.   * Andy - Histogram addition to pS-B, writing clients.

See wiki page for updates.     * Talking with Martin about involving Ahmed in the process - he may start to help.   * Maxim      * Nothing Major     * Will talk with Aaron about the _service restarting_ work he is doing.     * Mini-discussion on what Aaron is doing and the other possible approaches (e.g. low level scripts to restart/watch daemons vs something more sophisticated like Nagios).  Will push out to mailing list.   * Jason     * BWC - Consuming most time.  Will be uploading some GUIs pretty soon that are being contributed to REDDnet     * LHC Outreahch       * USAtlas - Keeping close contact on the open critical bug.  Whole group was a little ticked, but they are happy we are fixing it.         * USCMS - Got an invite to the Tier2 Briefing 10/27 - will give a brief talk on the disk, what it is used for, and some recommendations.   * Brian     * Nothing   * Fahad     * Working with the service in branch     * Installing SLAC USAtlas servers   * Jeff     * At SCinet Staging     * Deploying perfSONAR servers     * Note there will be jobs posted for new positions at Internet2   * Joe     * Adding 'tasks' to the Issue tracker   * Inder     * Still coming up to speed, nothing new to report   * Aaron     * Working w/ Andy on the USAtlas bugs     * SC development (weathermaps)   * Andy     * Working w/ Aaron on the USAtlas bugs     * Setting up a pSB testing and development environment     * Looking at what it will take to implement the pieces to plot jitter   * Ezra     * BWC Prep w/ Jason     * Giving a talk at SC on Phoebus and Grid FTP # Actions from last call:   * ~~ESnet: add 'current' issues to issue tracker~~ # pS-Ptk stability update (Andy/Aaron)   * Andy: Setting up test instances at LBL.  Trying to mimic the setup of USAtlas (in throughput and latency).  Set up on Friday, was hoping to hang it over the weekend, but nothing happened yet.  Have noticed some data points missing   * Andy: Aaron ha suggested starting 2 master instances to see the effects.  Both are running right now and have not done anything strange.     * Aaron: Released 3.1.1a today to Philippe/Shawn at AGLT2.  Hoping to get feedback on:     * If the fix solves the _full ramdisk_ problem     * If the fix restarts _down_ services     * If the fix does not blow away old configurations on disk   * Will be ready for a release next week if this fix proves ok (need testers).   * Mini discussion on what the error is vs how to address it.  Aaron explains its related to how knoppix works (it needs a disk, so it mounts the ram disk).  All of our stuff runs _through_ the ramdisk to write the underlying storage (we write to a /scratch file on the real disk).  Joe ponders if this fix was harder or took more time than converting to LiveCD.  Aaron notes that LiveCD will do something similar.   * Brian mentions that _/var/mail/error_ is filling up with small files - mostly cron errors.  Aaron thinks another cleanup script would work, Brian says we could just stop cron from emailing too.  Joe mentions cfengine scripts as being a solution.     * _*ACTION*_: Joe will add something to wiki about cfengine.     * Jason will relay information to USAtlas on status.   # LHC Community Update (Jason)   * USAtlas - Cheesed off at the error, vented to me last week.  I think they just want to make sure we are are moving on it.  Keeping them updated.     * USCMS - Giving a mini talk on pS to this group 10/27.   # Coordination of short term GUI development   * _*ACTION*_: Andy will send a mail to the mailing list outlining what he was tasked with developing.  Aaron/Jason will add to this to see if there is overlap.   # What should the ISO do with data longer term? (Requested by Brian)   * Brian: noticed that the disks are filling up (FAST) with owamp data.  No ability to delete this data (yet).     * Jeff: can clear out data on many different levels and solutions can be complex or simple     * Scripts to backup up     * Scripts to hot-drop and re-start services     * Databases vs files   * _*ACTION*_: Aaron to organize a separate meeting with people interested in this  # Terena conference submission?   * Extended abstract (1-2 pages) due Nov 30th   * Conference is June 1 in Lithuania   * Brian wants to submit an ESnet deployment paper   * Marcos has a paper on IP summarization too.   # Future topics:   * Google MLab     * It would be great if we could start registering all these nodes in pS.     * LS archive for finding an NDT server. How do you know what things are available 'publicly' or not.     * Pushing to make the MLab data available. It would be great if we could provide a pS interface for them.   * NSF request to fund a workshop for perfSONAR.     * How would a researcher use pS to fulfill research goals?     * How do you get tool developers to publish via pS?     * NSF will be creating a steering committee for this workshop.     * Hopefully NSF is interested in funding pS.   * Service Monitoring and Config management     * gLS 'monitoring'   * Status collection for low-level device PMs     * The DCN status page that was put together for the monitoring is a relatively simple collector that grabs various performance counters and other data about elements on the Cienas. Right now, it confines itself to things that look like interfaces. There's a similar project that Jon Dugan has been working on for ESnet called ESxSNMP that grabs performance counters for SNMP hosts. It would be good to have a discussion about how these two monitoring infrastructures might work together. At minimum, it might be feasible to get the TL1 monitoring components to use the same metadata database and counter databases, and, implicitly, perfsonar interface.     * Another possible area of discussion include how the monitoring above can be extended to support collection and storage of topological information. The topology information could include how interfaces are connected together internally in the switch/router (via cross-connects, adaptation or whatever). It might also be good to think about how to collect information about how switches/routers are wired together.     * It'd be feasible to grab and store TL1/SNMP alarms as part of the collection framework. Though, that might be more reasonably done via nagios plugins.     * Currently in the regular testing setup screen, if a user doesn't specify a 'community', the node can not be found. We need to figure out a way to 'find' these nodes. Is there a reasonable way to 'find' them? (Perhaps if there is no 'community' specificied, it should get a 'default' of some kind?)==== ACTIONS ==== * _*ACTION*_: Joe will add something to wiki about cfengine.  * _*ACTION*_: Andy will send a mail to the mailing list outlining what he was tasked with developing.

Have not commited into svn yet. SLAC has two new pS servers.    Marcos: Working on testing the LS.    Eric: Open DevNet - plateform to deploy machines and routers on the internet. The purpose is to test pS protocols and scaling and use as a Q/A mechanism. Can open it to anyone in the community. If anyone wants access, contact Eric.    Aaron: Working on a service watcher script for the pS-PerformanceTK. Aiming for another release for the pS-PerfTK before SC (new kernel, watcher script).    Inder: Still ramping up. NML WG is progressing. Will be looking for volunteers for OGF docs.    Joe:  Working on CFengine scripts to run tests. Trying to understand owamp data on the ESnet backbone. Looking at adding 20 more machines.    Jason: OGF, no NMC meeting but docs were not updated anyway. Infrastructure area update. He would like the documents updated more frequently. NML was not as contentious as it could have been. Finally decided on the definition of a network. Went over Martin's proposal for the service element. Need more outside participation for NML. NSI - progress is being made. Focusing on SC into the future - bandwidth challenge, Internet2 booth, SCinet.    Ezra: No updates. Working on bandwidth challenge for SC. Noticing performance differences between iperf and nuttcp. iperf versioning seems to be an issue.    Maxim: Not much since last.    Jeff: JET pS regular tests. Review OGF documents. # Coordination of short term GUI development # What should the ISO do with data longer term?

Final release candidate going out this week. Performance problems with RC4 bwctl.    * Rich: Trying to close out JET/LSN perfSONAR deployment plan. Rich's last day will be at the end of FMM week, he is moving on to DOE. Good luck Rich!    * Aaron: Looking at performance issues with bandwidth tests. It looks likely that this is a network driver issue (potentially a VMI issue as well). Also working on performance monitoring in the ION interface.    * Joe: DICE meeting update.    * Brian: Helping look at RC's. Fully deployed OWAMP on ESnet. Testing of cache.pl script.    * Maxim: Finishing up RPMs with 2 binary rpms. One 32-bit, one 64-bit.    * Jeff: dice update and roadmap things added to the agenda. # Previous Actions    * Joe will send request for implementation specific web sites in perfsonar.net space.    * Joe will send email to EU participants to find out who will be at DICE meeting.    * Brian will work with Marcos, Martin and perhaps Joe on [LSScalabilityInvestigation scalability testing] of the hLS/gLS. # Release Activities   * Next RC coming out Friday. Looking at throughput performance problem.  Need to discuss bug-release schedules. # Updating of roadmap: http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/wiki/PPStrawMan   * Jeff asked that everyone review the roadmap and open issues so we can create a new roadmap for the next 6-12 months. # Review of DICE meeting    * Joe: Overall went well, still concerned about methodology/goals across atlantic. # Update from the ecenter project    * FNAL/ESnet working together on portal to pS data. Working on 1st year milestones. Main task for ESnet will be to add traceroute data to all bwctl/iperf results so you know the path for the test. FNAL milestones will be on creating prototypes to show multiple paths with traceroute and will likely include analysis. It will allow collaboration as well. # LSScalability testing update # LHC/Atlas deployments (status update)    * Waiting for the final release. Will install at the testing sites soon. Will have others install within a week if all goes well. # Future topics:   * Google MLab     * It would be great if we could start registering all these nodes in pS.     * LS archive for finding an NDT server. How do you know what things are available 'publicly' or not.     * Pushing to make the MLab data available. It would be great if we could provide a pS interface for them.   * NSF request to fund a workshop for perfSONAR.     * How would a researcher use pS to fulfill research goals?     * How do you get tool developers to publish via pS?     * NSF will be creating a steering committee for this workshop.     * Hopefully NSF is interested in funding pS.   * Service Monitoring and Config management     * gLS 'monitoring'   * Status collection for low-level device PMs    The DCN status page that was put together for the monitoring is a relatively simple collector that grabs various performance counters and other data about elements on the Cienas. Right now, it confines itself to things that look like interfaces. There's a similar project that Jon Dugan has been working on for ESnet called ESxSNMP that grabs performance counters for SNMP hosts. It would be good to have a discussion about how these two monitoring infrastructures might work together. At minimum, it might be feasible to get the TL1 monitoring components to use the same metadata database and counter databases, and, implicitly, perfsonar interface.   * Another possible area of discussion include how the monitoring above can be extended to support collection and storage of topological information. The topology information could include how interfaces are connected together internally in the switch/router (via cross-connects, adaptation or whatever). It might also be good to think about how to collect information about how switches/routers are wired together.   * It'd be feasible to grab and store TL1/SNMP alarms as part of the collection framework. Though, that might be more reasonably done via nagios plugins.   * Currently in the regular testing setup screen, if a user doesn't specify a 'community', the node can not be found.

Service is in python.  _*Jason*_ asks if this is the same thing that SLAC is doing.  _*Dan*_ says the backend is the same thing, but SLAC will do a frontend in perl,  LBL will be python.  Code will also be useful for building other services in python._*Jason*_ asks if this will be related to the USATLAS request/work (_*BNL*_, _*UMich*_) for GridFTP exposure in pS.  _*Brian/Dan*_ talk about how it fits their needs, they are not collaborating.  _*Dan*_ also mentions work that someone at LBL (Josh?) is doing to make monitoring widgets using the google APIs.  He may use python servers to get there.  _*Dan*_ asks about testing in the framework(s).  _*Jason*_ points out work that was done in the EU, and _*Brian*_ points out his work ([https://svn.internet2.edu/svn/perfSONAR-PS/trunk/test_harness/ here]).  The pSPS test harness is not about interoperability - more of a functional test.  *Dan/Maxim* discuss Maxim's SOAPUI WSDLs/Schemas and how they fit in with the EU testing.  _*Maxim*_ points out that the WSDL file (at least how he is used to using it) is pretty basic (e.g. describes the functionality and the input - a doc/lit xml message).  The validation of the message is done via the schema (at least in SOAPUI).  pSPS tools do not validate against a schema currently (perl support is poor - libxml can validate against an XSD, but it is slow).  _*Dan*_ mentions that it is possible to validate more than just a doc/lit glob in WSDL.  Each service shoul be offering this to encourage interop (and to easily generate parsing libs, etc.)._*Dan*_ asks about what the expected request/response structure is in pS.  _*Jason*_ responds that its all related to the original service (the RRDMA) in that there is some paritally constructed md element that drives the interaction, that is matched to the backend, and then things happen w/ regards to what the message type may be.  The LS is a special case (e.g. xpath/xquery).  Dan sends along examples he worked on:{{{## Schema for binary range queries## Author: Dan Gunter <dkgunter@lbl.gov># Created: 8/30/2009#default namespace = "http://acs.lbl.gov/~dang/brq/"start = queryquery = element brq { ns*, expr }# namespacens = element ns {   attribute prefix { xsd:QName },   attribute value { xsd:token }}# expressionexpr = element expr {   ( attribute op { "and" | "or" }, expr, expr ) |   ( attribute op { "not" }, expr ) |   leaf}leaf =   ( attribute op { "cmp" }, leaf_content )leaf_content = ( rel, var, const )# comparison relational operators (rel)rel = rel_eq | rel_range | rel_rerel_eq = attribute rel { "=" | "!=" }rel_range = attribute rel { "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" }rel_re = attribute rel { "=~" }text_rel = ( rel_eq | rel_re )num_rel = ( rel_eq | rel_range )# variablevar = attribute var { text }# constconst = attribute const { text }num_const = attribute const { xsd:decimal }}}}and{{{## Example derived binary range query schema that restricts# the elements to 'foo', which is text, and 'bar',# which is numeric.## Author: Dan Gunter <dkgunter@lbl.gov># Created: 8/30/2009#include "binary_range_query.rnc" {   leaf_content = (      ( text_rel, foo_var, const ) |      ( num_rel, bar_var, num_const )   )}foo_var = attribute var { "foo" }bar_var = attribute var { "bar" }}}}_*Jason*_ thinks these are good examples of what a query/request could be. _*Dan/Monte*_ will refine more.  _*Dan*_ discusses current work plan: * Branch from trunk * Jon/Monte/Dan will work from there_*Jason*_ mentions that they should expect to release the end-product as source, should make an RPM package (will be easier to include on pSPT).  _*Jason*_ asks some followup questions on how the service works (to see if this would be a valuable addition to the pSPT).  Service consumes gridftp logs and then exposes an MA.  Does not need to be on the same machine as gridftp software (exporting via netlogger currently?).  Group decides further meetings will be on-demand.  === 20090824Video ======= Agenda/Minutes ==== # Attendees:   * Maxim - Fermilab   * Fahad - SLAC   * Marcos - UDel   * Rich - Internet2   * Aaron - Internet2   * Jason - Internet2     # Release Activities for RC3   * Open Bugs (See Jason's Note from 8/20)     * Of the bugs open for RC3 in the spreadsheet, 1/2 to 3/4 are ready to be closed pending testing.   * Release Schedule     * Bugs Addressed/Tested by Weds (8/26)       * Hard stop weds night - unfinished items will be migrated to RC4     * Disk Generated/Tested by Thurs (8/27)       * Aaron will be testing disks locally all day Thursday     * Release to Testers by Fri (8/28)       * Released to website/testers by morning.   # Release Schedule Post RC3   * RC4 - 9/11     * Before DICE Meeting   * Release - 9/23     * May slip up to Friday (9/25) of this week if needed.   * Dates may slide depending on bugs/staff availability      # SVN Update (Aaron)     * Move slated for 8/27 - 8/28 (Aaron will announce).     * Move trunk to 'oldtrunk' branch   * Move RELEASE branch to new trunk   * Will follow svn usage rules from now on === 20090817Video ======= Agenda/Minutes ==== # Attendees: Marcos, Brian, Aaron, Jason, Joe, Jeff, Priscilla # Team Updates:    * Marcos: Researching fault analysis.    * Brian: Testing new releases.

First round of testers - lots of bug reports. RC2 released this morning. Major fixes for networking scripts and backing-store fixes. Added link to pingER GUI, added fix for pS-B.   * _*Aaron*_: Working on propoosals. Working on bugs as they come up.   * _*Maxim*_: Finished admin-gui for pingER. Unfortunately not unified like aaron's version. Feature set is different. It would be nice to have both. Would like to discuss GUI architecture going forward, and how full functionality can be implemented for all services. Also testing new toolkit on KOI boxes.   * _*Rich*_: Email from Bigrow - has RC2 in.   * _*Jeff*_: Working on proposals and toolkit bugs.   * _*Marcos*_: Working on statistical anomoly detection that he hopes can grow into an eventual pS service. # Review _*Actions*_ and _*Issues*_   * _*Jason*_ - ~~will update release pages as needed~~   * _*Jason*_ - ~~will contact Marcos about IP Summarization~~   * _*Jason/Martin/Jeff*_ - Finish editing OGF documents   * _*Jason/Martin/Jeff*_ - Complete/Upload NML document   * _*Aaron/Maxim*_ - Review admin GUIs and unify as much as possible.   * _*Joe*_ - Suggest interim steps to improve LS user experience, that don't require new software deployments.   * _*All*_ - Review release pages # Toolkit 'branding'   * Maxim is unhappy about any organizational branding. Current 'plan' is in issue 205. (Jeff - my intent is to slightly brand the toolkit as Internet2 just as the NPToolkit has always been. Likewise, individual tools on the toolkit have had some organizational branding: NPAD from PSC, pingER from SLAC/FNAL. If there is serious concern about this I'm happy to discuss it with anyone and I'm willing to concider changes. But please consider the fact that the only way some of the organizations can stay involved in developing these tools is if they can publicly get some credit for having done something for the communities they serve. It is extremely important to me that no groups are slighted here - so please review and speak up when public announcements are sent out for review.

Brian gave minor update that he has been involved in many sysadmin activities.       * Brian - Has summer students working on visualization.  Jason provided with old WMap code.  2 students for WMap development, maybe one more for SNMP visualization.  Asks if we are aware of visualisation activities for geni (GRNOC is involved).  Jason will ask Matt Z/Jeff (N.B. Jason did ask and both are aware).     * Fermi     * Maxim - PingER GUI completed, used [http://www.catalystframework.org/ catalyst] and liked it.  Would like to see other GUIs use it as well to keep look/feel the same and to speed up development.  Fixing bugs (e.g. [http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/issues/detail?id=181 181]) and will give RPMs to Jason for uploading.         * Minor conversation between Maxim/Brian on the speed of PingER GUI.  Brian states it is slow for large chunks of data, is there some sort of status _spinner_ to indicate progress?  Maxim says yes, Jason/Aaron confirm.  Maxim explains how it works in relation to MA and that slowness may be MA related but also tweaked GUI parameters to need less data.           * UDel     * Marcos - IPSummarization work is progressing, converted to perl and awaiting Jason/Martin/Jeff to start some form of evaluation.  Jason will get the ball rolling this week.  Next project is anomaly detection.        # Review _*Actions*_ and _*Issues*_   * No actions posted from last week   * Jason has uploaded new RC (not posted but was a holdover)   * OGF docs are ready for Review   * Add more if anyone thinks of any... # KOI performance update - *Aaron*   * Aaron reports nothing new beyond Brian's observation that new kernel/driver software helped.  Seems to be problems w/ perfSONAR-BUOY now (database related).  Jason thinks it may be related to the new _package_ structure in SVN: perfSONAR-BUOY was never converted so may not work correctly.  Jason/Aaron will look into this.  Jason recommends sticking with _trunk_ version of pSB.       # Aaron's GUIs   * Aaron presented some GUIs:     * _*Scheduled Tests*_ - https://lab246.internet2.edu/admin/regular_testing.cgi     * _*BWCTL*_ - https://lab246.internet2.edu/admin/bwctl.cgi     * _*OWAMP*_ - https://lab246.internet2.edu/admin/owamp.cgi     * _*Running Services*_ - https://lab246.internet2.edu/admin/services.cgi     * _*NTP*_ - https://lab246.internet2.edu/admin/ntp.cgi     * _*Administrative Info*_ - https://lab246.internet2.edu/admin/administrative_info.cgi   * Maxim: See comments from email list regarding GUI vs. Web GUI.     * Aaron: Explains that the dojo stuff he is using does what maxim wants. CGI::AJAX may make something not look as Maxim would like to see it.   * Maxim/Aaron: Discussion regarding look feel + architecture.  Maxim thinks we should use catalyst as the framework (at a minimum we should all use the same thing - catalyst is easy to use and fully featured).     * Aaron: discusses why he choose dojo (IDC folks use it, also fully featured, CSS etc. built right in).     * Jason: Can discussion architecture details later - should focus on layout/content for this discussion   * Jason has some comments on layout/structure/content:     * Finds some of the _longer_ configuration screens confusing.  E.g. if you have to scroll to see all content, there may be too much content on the page.  Suggests a _Wizard_ interface that gives a small number of choices per screen - less confusion as to what to do (example: regular setup has too many options near the bottom, need to know what each 'click' is going to do).  Brian remarks that a _wizard_ will frustrate power users.  Two interfaces is hard to maintain, so need to weigh the positives and negatives of each.       * Some of the _choices_ for checkboxes and similar have a mouseover hover property. These look like hyperlinks but don't click.  Could we make them a pop-up menu with more information?     * Names of things are not conistent (e.g. _throughput_ testing vs _BWCTL_ testing vs _perfSONAR-BUOY_ testing).  Aaron will suggest alternatives.    * Brian's last suggestion is for more advanced options (e.g. TCP cong. alg) # Release Activities - *Jason*   # perfSONAR-PS 3.1 status      * New Bugs - these have been identified and are working to be closed.       * RC Generation - still generating on demand.     # perfSONAR-PS 3.1+ status      * See [pSPS200907Release]     * Tasks Assigned - read the web page to see if you are on the hook for anything.

Will contact Jason for latest weathermap developments. Also have a new student working on iperf. Anyone interested in specific features should add things to the iperf tracker.   * Joe: Have 2 topology servers for ESnet installed now. Updated automatically - data should be current within 2 hours. Unsure how compliant it is. Joe would like to discuss svn externals.   * Evangelis: Showed google-earth visualizations at OGF.   * Marcos: Working on Perl version of IPTree.   * Maxim: Fixing statistical bug in pingER. Have new RPM's. Explored catalyst for GUIs. Can handle large loads. Moved pingER data UI under catalyst under trunk. Will start a wiki page to start evaluation of moving pS-PS GUIs into the same framework.   * Jeff: OGF last week. NM-WG is progressing as expected. NMC is on track, but more input is needed from GN3 participants. NML was contentious as expected, but progress was made. Specifically, lifetime concept was agreed to. And, the 'relation' element in UNIS makes the UNIS model much closer to NDL. Watch for notes/docuements. # Review _*Actions*_ and _*Issues*_   * [http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/20090518Video/20090601perfsonar-ps-issues.xls]      * Brian: will look at the data since it has been running a while now.      * Joe: We should be tracking progress of issues week by week. # Next VC will be 6/8.=== 20090518Video ======= Agenda/Minutes ==== # Attendees: Brian, Jason, Marcos, Aaron, Jeff, Martin, Fahad # Team Updates   * Brian: KOI network drivers.

This will touch on global identifiers, topology, technology/layer abstraction and monitoring architecture. We will have phone conferences in the weeks leading up to this to articulate use cases and general architecture. The plan is for the meeting to be used to fully describe that architecture to everyone involved, and break it down into action items for development.If IDC developers like, a portion of the day can be set aside for other current topics.====== pS/IDC Attendees ====== * In Person   # Jason Zurawski - Internet2   # Jeff Boote - Internet2   # Aaron Brown - Internet2   # Andrew Lake - Internet2   # Maxim Grigoriev - Fermilab   # Tom Lehman - ISI   # Xi Yang - ISI   # Chris Tracy - MAX   # Jarda Flidr - MAX   # Evangelos Chaniotakis - ESnet   # Joe Meztger - ESnet   # Jon Dugan - ESnet   # Chin Guok - ESnet   # Martin Swany - UDel   # Ezra Kissel - UDel   # Marcos Portnoi - UDel   # Guilherme Fernandes - UDel   # John Vollbrecht * Remote   # Brian Tierney - ESnet   # David Robertson - LBL   # Chris Robb - Internet2   # TBD - ESnet====== IDC Agenda and Notes ======See the Agenda here: [20090501IDCAgenda].==== Local Information ====Some compiled local information from a _semi-local_.  Will add more over time, requests for specific information would be great.  ===== DC Office =====Located in the _Golden Triangle_ neighborhood, borders Dupont/Scott Circle and George Washington University.  Not known for great food or restaurants (walk somewhere north or east for the good stuff).  Office Address:{{{1150 18th Street, NWSuite 1020Washington, DC 20036}}}This is between _*L*_ and _*M*_ streets on _*18th*_ (left side of street when facing North, white building between 2 parking garages).  The office is on the 10th floor (see the lobby attendant when entering).  _*From Orange/Blue Metro Line*_:Get off at the *Farragut West* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=38 stop].  There are two exits, please exit on _18th Street_.  Walk *North* along 18th street (*Straight* as you exit the station) and cross over _K_ and _L_ Streets.  _*N.B._ There is construction on the West (left) side of _18th Street_ between _K_ and _L_.  1150 is midway between _L_ and _M_ on the left hand side, it is a white building (there is a construction fence outside of our entrance)._*From Red Metro Line*_:Get off at the *Farragut North* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=4 stop].  There are three exits, please exit on one of the _L Street and Conn. Ave_ exits.  Walk *West* along L street (towards oncoming traffic) and cross over _18th_ Streets.  Make a right (*North*) onto _18th Street_, 1150 is midway between _L_ and _M_ on the left hand side, it is a white building (there is a construction fence outside of our entrance).http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/20090429Meet/dc_map.png===== Remote Participation =====Video access is available, we will be using the ESnet conference bridge: * GDS: 00113498255555 * Phone: 1-510-883-7860 then 8255555# at the prompt. ===== Transportation (Airports) =====[http://www.mwaa.com/national/ Reagan National Airport]DCA is located along the Potomac river in Arlington VA.  Due to flight restrictions there are limited cross country flights each day, so finding a variety of arrival departure times is sometimes challenging.  DCA is directly connected to the Washington DC metro system via the *Yellow* and *Blue* lines making it easy to get to Crystal City (for the SMM) and into the city (where the Internet2 Office is located).  Allow 20 minutes to travel on the Metro between the DC office and the airport.  Security lines may be long during peak periods (Afternoons) - allow at least 45 minutes for security.[http://www.mwaa.com/dulles Dulles International Airport]IAD is located in Chantilly VA, which is fairly far out (and very close to were Jason lives).  There is a wider variety of airlines and schedules available here.  Unfortunately there is limited access to transportation.  The Metro does not extend to IAD (yet) so using the public bus ([http://www.wmata.com/bus/timetables/view.cfm?line=49 Route 5A], drops off at *Rosslyn* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=41 station] on the *Orange* and *Blue* lines) or a private coach service ([http://www.washfly.com/flyer_bus_about.htm Washington Flyer] picks up/drops off at the *West Falls Church* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=101 station] on the *Orange Line*) would be necessary.  It may take upwards of an hour to get from the airport to the DC office.  Security lines may be very long in the mornings and evenings - allow 45 minutes to an hour for security and 10 minutes for transportation to gates (shuttle buses).  ===== Transportation (Ground) =====Using the [http://www.wmata.com/rail/maps/map.cfm Metro] is by far the easiest way to get around.  I would suggest buying a _SmartTrip_ electronic card (comes with $10 loaded on it) and using this for your stay.  The card can be loaded with more value as you need it in any station.  This is preferred to attempting to purchase paper tickets for each ride, or trying to figure out rules regarding entry vs exit fare, etc.Shuttle services such as [http://www.washfly.com/flyer_bus_about.htm Washington Flyer] and [http://www.supershuttle.com/ Super Shuttle] can get you to the airports.Taxis are also common, note some are _un-licensed_ and no longer follow the _zone_ fare rules.===== Suggested Hotel =====We recommend staying at the [http://cwp.marriott.com/wasgw/internettwo09/ Crystal Gateway Marriott] when attending these meetings. (Everyone attending the SMM will already be there, so this is where most people will already be staying.) This hotel offers a competitive rate compared to hotels in the DC business district.  The information page is [http://cwp.marriott.com/wasgw/internettwo09/ here].  The hotel address is:{{{Crystal Gateway Marriott1700 Jefferson Davis HighwayArlington, Virginia 22202 }}}From the hotel we will take the [20090429Meet#DC_Office Blue Line] in the morning to get to the office.  Note it may take about a half hour and trains will be crowded in the morning.  ===== Alternative Hotels =====There are several other hotels available within walking distance of the DC office, prices will vary (check a travel site for best deals - note that the listed prices were captured in late February and will adjust with the local market).  April is the start of tourist season, so prices may begin to be expensive.  Most hotels offer government rates.   [http://www.thequincy.com/ The Quincy Hotel] - $169 (on the Quincy Web Site){{{Phone: 202-223-4320 or 1-800-424-2970Fax: 202-293-49771823 L Street NW (around the corner from the office - between 18th and 19th Streets)Washington, DC 20036}}}[http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/hi/1/en/hd/wasct?irs=null  Holiday Inn Central] - $189 (on the Holiday Inn Web Site){{{Phone: 202-483-2000 or 1-800-248-0016Fax: 202-797-10781501 Rhode Island Avenue NW (off of Scott Circle)Washington, DC 20036}}}[http://www.hamiltonhoteldc.com/index.html Crowne Plaza Hamilton] - $144{{{Phone: 202-682-0111Fax: 202-682-9525 14th and K Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA}}}[http://www.starwoodhotels.com/fourpoints/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1237 Four Points by Sheraton] - $148  {{{Phone: 202-289-7600201 K Street N.W. Washington, DC 20005}}}[http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/wasrw-renaissance-m-street-hotel Renaissance on M Street] - $159{{{Phone: 202-775-0800Fax: 202-331-94911143 New Hampshire Avenue NWWashington, District Of Columbia 20037 USA}}}[http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1761 Westin Hotel] - $179{{{Phone: 202-429-17001400 M Street NWWashington, DC 20005}}}===== Restaurants =====Caribou Coffee‎{{{1800 M St (Corner of 18th and M - close to office)}}}Starbucks{{{1734 L St NW (On L between 18th and 17th - close to the office)}}}[http://www.mccormickandschmick.com/main.cfm?action=location&element=initial&locID=38 McCormick and Schmick] - Seafood{{{Phone: 202-861-22331625 K Street NW ( K Street between 16th and 17th street)}}}[http://www.dailygrill.com/dg18thandm.html Daily Grill] - American{{{Phone - 202-822-52821200 18th Street NW (M Street and 18th street)}}}[http://www.gbrowns.com Georgia Brown] - Low Country Southern{{{Phone - 202-393-4499950 15th Street NW (corner of 15 th and K Street)}}}[http://www.dccoast.com DC Coas] - Seafood{{{Phone - 202-216-59881401 K Street (corner of 14 th and K Street)}}}[http://www.bistrobis.com/vidalia/index.asp Vidalia] - Southern{{{Phone- 202-659-19901990 M Street NW (bet. 19th and 20th streets)}}}[http://www.penangusa.com/location_dc.html Penang] - Malaysian{{{Phone - 202-822-87701837 M Street NW (corner of M and 19 th Street)}}}[http://www.spezie.com Spezie] - Modern Italian{{{Phone - 202-467-07771736 L Street NW (between 18th Street and Connecticut Avenue )}}}[http://www.fin-dc.com Fin] - Modern American Seafood{{{Phone - 202-530-44301200 19th Street NW (between M and N Streets)}}}[http://www.smithandwollensky.com/Washington.asp Smith and Wollensky] - Steakhouse{{{Phone - 202-466-11001112 19th Street NW (between L and M Streets)}}}[http://www.legalseafoods.com/index.cfm/ac/locations_detail/id/24 Legal Seafood] - Seafood{{{Phone: 202-496-11112020 K Street NW (between 20th and 21st Streets)}}}[http://www.mackeyspub.com/homedc.html Mackeys Public House] - Irish Pub{{{Phone 202-331-76671823 L Street NW}}}[http://www.maithai.us/index.html Mai Thai] - Thai{{{Phone: 202-452-68701200 19th Street.

Betas are being generated and tested internally      * Documentation Reviews       * Developers Finish (3/27)         * JZ: All developers have completed this.  _User_ guides are still outstanding, but will have to be a work in progress for the next couple of weeks.       * Reviews Due (4/3)         * JZ: Did not receive all reviews on time.  AB/JZ reviewed the remaining items to make the deadline.  Will still need reviewers after the _user_ documentation is complete     * Uploading to repository       * AB/JZ have access, Maxim is still on vacation (will ask him if he wants access to rpm/source repo).       * Testing       * Testing Procedure         * JZ has a list of interested parties to send testers to.  Should test locally first (on as many different OS/Arch combinations as possible).  Testing should focus on:           # Install Procedure vs instructions           # Install success on specific OS/Architectures           # Configuration vs instructions           # WS Test cases included in the package           # Other factors (firewall configuration, etc.) # Other Issues   # Wiki-reorg     * There were no objections to cleaning the wiki   # [IPSummarization] Comments     * JM/MP talked about recent comments on IS-WG mailing list.     * JM would like to see goals/metrics listed that are used to evaluate one summarization alg. vs another.  Has suggestions:       # ratio of entries in result over entries in initial set (e.g. compression)       # ratio of unique IP addresses in initial set over unique IP addresses in result set (e.g. if we go from a /32 to a /31, we have increased the number we are claiming by 255)     * MP understands, and will try to describe the definition of _good_ summarization on the wiki for conversation.     * AB cautions about hLSs advertising _false_ ranges (over summarizing) especially when dealing with data sets that are not continuous.  JZ explains that MP should be testing with _domain_ data sets (e.g. ESnet) but then combining 2 data sets (e.g. ESnet and APAN for example) to see how the alg. behaves.     * JM closes with a statement about accuracy when collapsing IP blocks (adjacent blocks = good, non = troublesome)   # Circuit Monitoring update     * Status of exmples (aaron)       * AB reports no change since last time   # SNMP-MA ESnet new database integration update     * JM is not aware of progress, but that doesn't mean there isn't any.       * JM is pretty sure Jon will make it to DC, we can discuss this topic during the meeting.     * JM wants to ensure we deal with diet constraints for the meeting.  JZ has action of sending out something.     # LHC/Atlas deployments (status update)     * RC reports that things are going about the same as before, still waiting on BNL to be _fixed_.     * JZ notes that REDDnet folks are happy Ultralight is in working order again. # Next meeting will be 4/13==== ACTIONS ==== * *MP*: Update [IPSummarization] based on email/conference call suggestions * *JZ*: Coordinate testing * *JZ*: Send out lunch email for F2F meeting for diet constraints * *AB*: Update Circuit Examples * *All*: Review documentation=== 20090330Video ======= Agenda/Minutes ==== # Attendees: Aaron, Marcos, Jason, Brian, Jeff # Team Updates   # Internet2     * Jeff: pS-B owamp database code.     * Aaron: Packaging/documentation for 3 services. Still needs minor doc on status. Working on examples.     * Jason: Finished yum repo. Finished doc/testing on services. Worked with PSU on deployment issues.   # ESnet     * Brian: Working on pS-B deployment. Mostly done. Lots of suggestions for improved logging. BNL debugging. Many network problems.   # UDel     * Marcos: Prototypes for IPSummarization. Examples on wiki, wants comments on what is good. (We want to encourage everyone interested in this to attend IS-WG meetings.)   # FNAL # Review _*Actions*_ from last call # perfSONAR-PS v3.1 Release Update   * See [pSPS20090327Release] for details     * Check individual progress.     * Documentation Reviews       * Developers Finish (3/27)       * Reviews Due (4/3)     * Alpha Testing     * Beta Testing # RPM package question   * Since we are making available RPMs of software that we don't produce and may be available elsewhere, should we tag our RPMs with a special version identifier (e.g. -1.ps or -1.internet2)? # Circuit Monitoring # SNMP-MA ESnet new database integration update # LHC/Atlas deployments (status update) # Next meeting will be 4/6==== ACTIONS ==== * Joe/Others: Please look at the IPSummarization page and comment. http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/wiki/IPSummarization. * Jeff: Porting/installation testbed.

Need to worry about interoperating especially on legacy systems that would not upgrade.   * Aaron: Old topology in use for E2Emon systems was not flexible (especially for what we want to do down the road with IS activities and more efficient queries).  Hard to go between old and new.   * Joe: Agrees there are problems, but we need to show how any new method is an evolution of the old (not starting new).  We need to move forward by making better - not re-inventing.  Most looks ok.  Has a concern about the demarc issue (e.g. which side monitors something that is shared).     * Aaron: Sent out email talking about this.  Will always be some overlap to worry about, have _point of view_ for circuits.     * Joe and All would like more examples.  Aaron will provide.      # perfSONAR-PS v3.1 Release Update   * See [pSPS20090327Release] for details     * Check individual progress.       * Jason - Writing tests cases and documentation       * Aaron - Same       * Maxim - same       * All three will alert when doc is ready for reviewers       * Alpha testing this week       * Beta testing next week       * Maxim can wait to implement changes suggested in aarons code review      * Code reviews by the 20th.       * See the reviews here: [pSPS20090327Release#Code_Review_Reviews]        * _*COMPLETED*_         * Maxim         * Guilherme         * Brian         * Joe         * Marcos         * Jason         * Aaron       * _*MISSING BUT EXCUSED*_         * Jeff     * Documentation Reviews       * Developers Finish (3/27)       * Reviews Due (4/3)     * Open Bugs are all now closed or held over       * _19_ - _*Aaron/Maxim*_ - ~~PingER GUI gLS pingable hosts~~         * _73_ - _*Jason*_ - ~~Client::LS Registration Logic Re-arrange~~         * Addressed, but held over till 3.1+           * _79_ - _*Jason*_ - ~~Empty gLS/hLS Messages~~       * _84_ - _*Jason*_ - ~~Exit MA service if no data is present~~           * _85_ - _*Jason*_ - ~~add verbose logging on errors for ma/ls~~       * _105_ - _*Jason*_ - ~~hLS Summarization of DCN Data~~         * Held over for 3.1+       * _109_ - _*Jason*_ - ~~gLS Discovery of IP Addresses~~       * _110_ - _*Jason*_ - ~~perfSONAR-BUOY Data Query Error~~       * _112_ - _*Jason*_ - ~~supportedEventType Examples for SNMP/pSB~~       * _116_ - _*Jason*_ - ~~Migrate getRRDData to SNMP.pm~~       * _62_ - _*Maxim*_ - ~~pingER-MA requires 'hostname" type attribute in endPointPair~~          * _66_ - _*Maxim*_ - ~~PingER Collection Errors~~          * _81_ - _*Maxim*_ - ~~PingER Resolution of IPaddress/Hostnames~~ # Code Review Topics   * Jason reads major areas to address for next time   * Maxim points out that the params validate doesn't handle validation errors well (uses Carp, etc.).  Could try to extend work Yee did on error classes (use call backs).  Can investigate after release for next time.   * Aaron/Maxim talk about script to generate POD (so that everyone keeps up with doc)   * Maxim/Aaron discuss moving modules out of root of perfSONAR-PS lib.  Held over till SMM, but we should take action this time.   * Segways into removing unnecessary code in general.  Need to be mindful of the _shared_ space.  Will require someone to physically do the cleaning.   # Other Topics   * Maxim brings up that the documentation regarding the NPToolkit is scattered and also not geared to the proper audience at times.     * Would like to see things better organized.  Currently there are many individual pages that answer some questions, but need a true step by step guide for the absolute beginner.     * Jason Points out [NPToolkitQuickStart]   * Rich/Jason/Maxim discuss what some groups (like USAtlas) do.  These groups usually maintain their own specific documentation and suggestions and point to ours when necessary.   * Joe points out that it will be up to communities to keep up, we can only do so much. # Next meeting will be 3/30==== ACTIONS ==== * Jason   * ~~Packaging Finalization~~   * ~~Documentation Finalization~~   * Beta Testing * Marcos   * IP Summarization   * Doc Reviews   * Beta Testing * Guilherme   * Doc Reviews   * Beta Testing * Joe   * Doc Reviews   * Beta Testing * Brian   * Doc Reviews   * Beta Testing * Maxim   * Figure out changes to make NPToolkit documentation easier to follow   * ~~Packaging Finalization~~   * ~~Documentation Finalization~~    * Doc Reviews   * Beta Testing * Aaron   * ~~Update Examples for circuit status~~   * ~~Packaging Finalization~~   * ~~Documentation Finalization~~   * Doc Reviews   * Beta Testing * Martin  * Jeff   * pSB Development   * Doc Reviews   * ~~Read CHEP - Give Maxim Feedback~~   === 20090316Video ======= Agenda/Minutes ==== # Attendees:    * Martin   * Guilherme   * Marcos   * Aaron   * Brian   * Jason   * Maxim   * Rich   * Joe  # Team Updates   # Internet2     * Jeff - On his way to DICE     * Aaron - Working on release activities (packaging, testing, documentation).

A couple of issues need to be discussed # UDP testing   * do we want to support high levels? If so, do we switch what services are run where?   * Brian asked "why"? A long discussion boiled down to the decision not to automatically run UDP tests, and not to automatically enable UDP testing. But, if UDP testing is enabled, to limit it to something around 75 Mbps. (This is fast enough to look for many problems, and slow enough to not be a problem with other things running on the host. It is roughly a factor of 10 less than where we saw most problems.) # CHEP # LHC/Atlas deployments # GUI followup   # wmap still on the list   # gLS related GUIs under development # GSoC # Next meeting will Feb 23.  # Other topics?=== 20090203Meet ======= Where ====Winter Joint Techs 2009, College Station, TX==== When ==== February 3, 2009  - 6 to ?

Brian will put FreeBSD on two back-to-back KOI systems. Aaron will put the Knoppix on two back-to-back Dell systems. With that information we can hopefully determine if this is OS related, or KOI hardware related. # Tech Report Status   * NSF should be credited on the tech-report   * It is no problem to liberally take from the tech-report for the CHEP paper. # Test Plan   * From memory review of the Test Plan. No changes requested. # RequirementsForCGI   * Light discussion on what would be desirable for IS related GUIs.   * hLS/gLS issues discussion     * Some discussion of how new measurements will go into the hLS/gLS cloud along with current technical limitations that require all namespaces to be known in advance. # Release Management   * Need to set timeline.     * Aiming for a final release of the Knoppix before SMM.     * Jeff/Jason will work on a timeline with that aim.   * Features for next release     * pS-B with OWAMP support     * gLS/hLS performance updates     * gLS/hLS GUIs     * CircuitMon (GLIF version)     * minimal-config knoppix   * Will attempt to organize a 'regionals' as betatesters   * Will likely need a version to support telepresence=== 20090126Video ======= Agenda/Minutes ==== # Attendees:  # Issue: Release Management   * Review Documents:     # ReleaseManagement       * Does this basic approach work for people?     # TestPlan       * Suggestions/Comments/Additions     # [RequirementsForDeploymentsCGI]       * Suggestions/Comments/Additions   * Next perfSONAR-PS (not perf Node yet) Release     * Target Date     * Services Involved       * Key Functionalities missing?       * Bugfixes outstanding?     * People Involved     * Outstanding issues # Next meeting will be at Jt Techs   * *Proposed:* Sunday, Feb 1    * Informal Poll of who is available when # Other topics?=== 20090112Video ======= Actions ====|| *who* || *task* |||| All || review/comment on gLS GUI:  http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/wiki/RequirementsForDeploymentsCGI |||| All || review/comment on testing: http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/wiki/TestPlan |||| All || (at jt techs) discuss/determine development priorities |||| aaron || UDP testing with back 2 back dell servers |||| brian || UDP testing with FreeBSD KOI servers |||| jason || wmap package |||| joe/maxim || try wmap package when available and provide feedback |||| aaron || look into packaging alarm/tl1 MA functionality (and see if JG is interested in trying) |||| jeff || writeup highlevel roadmap strawman post jt techs |||| martin || Determine 4 OGF WG status and actions we need to take |||| martin/brian/maxim || Paper publishing goals/strategy ||==== Agenda/Minutes ==== # Attendees: Jared, John Hicks, Jason, Aaron, Maxim, Joe, Brian, Martin, Rich, Marcos # Team Updates   # Internet2      * Aaron: UDP testing, owamp & bwctl releases. helping pS-B      * Jason: pS-B packaging and disting out on Internet2 observatory hosts. Jason has been working on release documentation. Also working on making SCinet data available.      * Rich: Met with Koreans - they are interested. It would be good to contact them for APAN meeting.      * Jeff: Working on    # IU      * John: starting on a visual-backbone MA. Followup on APAN pS workshop.   # UDEL      * Martin: nothing to update. OGF - should push forward the LS in the OGF-NSI group. Action: Figure out where we are in all 4 groups and what we need to do for next week.   # Ga Tech   # ESnet      * Joe: nearly done with security review      * Brian: UDP testing   # SLAC      * Jarad: nothing to update.

(BCP?)     * Focus on deployments/production       * GUIs       * How do you use these tools to actually debug problems?     * GUIs - easy to use, not demoware!     * Installation usability     * Need more user requirements?       * Need to bring users the first good data GUIs, then we can iterate with users.       * What specific visualizations do the users need? (First data must be there...)    * First priority to work on until Jt Techs is 'usability' (stability and installation). Other priorities will be worked on in person at Jt Techs. Jeff will put a high-level road map up for discussion after this meeting. # SC     * How much of the one-off coding can be turned into 'real' stuff?       * wmap: Jason has something others can try. Joe and Maxim will try it. Joe will be looking at trying to do something similar to the visible-backbone but perfsonar driven.       * wan-monitoring: Aaron said this is a couple of weeks away. John Graham might be a good user to attempt to work with on this. # Questions regarding gLS data displays - Brian   # Should we advertise things that are only available to certain groups (e.g. NDT servers on Interent2 backbone are not reachable to home users - do we note this?  How?)     * How do we manage expectations?     * We will need ways to discern what data is available to write good GUIs, this issue is not just about the 'publicity' pages.     * (Jeff suggestion: attack this problem by creating a GUI for actually addressing a specific performance problem - that GUI will need to figure this out...)     * Action: Everyone please review [RequirementsForDeploymentsCGI] # PAM/CHEP paper status   # Where to resubmit PAM paper and when - Brian/Martin      * Brian: Need something with a results section. Previous paper can be an LBL tech report.      * Lots of discussion on places to publish, and reasons for publishing.   # Important Dates for CHEP - Maxim      * Maxim: Chep paper should be about usefulness of perfSONAR for LHC community. # Next meeting will be Jan 26, 2:30 pm Eastern Time (Issue call on release mgmt)== Last Updated ==$Id$
