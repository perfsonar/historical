			        perfSONAR perfSONAR-BUOY MA Service

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About:
------

The perfSONAR-PS perfSONAR-BUOY Measurement Archive (MA) functions as both a
storage facility and a regular testing framework in conjunction with the BWCTL
and OWAMP measurement tools.  These archived measurements, stored in a MySQL
database, are exposed through a web services interface.  

The perfSONAR-BUOY MA provides a simple interface that is cable of exposing
these files after basic configuration for consumption by perfSONAR client
applications and services alike. The Web Service front end provides a uniform
method of access using the perfSONAR XML protocols and delivers the data in an
unambiguous manner, thus eliminating the mystery associated with the backend
storage. 

Installation:
-------------

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions
  
Configuration:
--------------

The perfSONAR-BUOY MA comes with a base configuration via the installation procedure.
This is meant to allow for immediate testing as well as serve as a guide for
customizing the service.  

There are several files that may be adjusted manually to configure this service
for a specific use case:

  - etc/daemon.conf: 
  
    Contains information that identifies the service uniquely and allows it to
    run in a given environment.  There are several options that should be
    changed:  
   
      service_accesspoint      - Change the "hostname" from localhost
      service_description      - Identifying information about the service
      service_name             - Service Name (short)  

    There are also several options that may be changed for a configuration:

      port                     - Port the service listens on
      endpoint                 - Endpoint to contact the service
      ls_registration_interval - Length of time (minutes) between contacting LS 
      enable_registration      - Turn on or off LS registration
    
    The rest of the items are normally not to be adjusted.  See also the service
    wiki page for more information:
    
      http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/wiki/perfSONARBUOY
    
  - etc/daemon_logger.conf:

    Contains information related to logging, there are three modes:
    
      Log::Dispatch::Screen     - Log messages to screen (useful for debugging)
      Log::Dispatch::Syslog     - Log messages to syslog facility
      Log::Dispatch::FileRotate - Log messages to specified file

    The rest of the items are normally not to be adjusted.  See also the service
    wiki page for more information:
    
      http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/wiki/perfSONARBUOY

  - owmesh.conf: 

      tbd

    See the wiki page for more information:

Starting/Stopping:
------------------

The service comes with init scripts that may be used to start and stop
operation:

  /etc/init.d/perfsonarbuoy_ma start
  /etc/init.d/perfsonarbuoy_ma stop
  /etc/init.d/perfsonarbuoy_ma restart

The service can also be run in a manual fashion (useful for debugging):

  perl bin/daemon.pl --verbose --conf=etc/daemon.conf --logger=etc/daemon_logger.conf
  
Before doing this, be sure to edit "etc/daemon_logger.conf" to enable "Screen"
debugging.

Testing:
--------

The service comes with a client application and several test messages that can
be used to test functionality.  There are many messages provided as examples, 
to test the service there are four that are recommended:

  etc/requests/EchoRequest.xml
  etc/requests/

These XXX will test the major functions of this service. To test:

  1) Ensure the service is started, it helps if you have configured logging to
     use the "Screen" so you may monitor the service's activities.

  2) Run the client:
  
     perl bin/client.pl URL FILENAME
  
  3) Compare the results of the test with the comments in each file.  Note there
     may be some differences (e.g. id values, key values).  
     
  4) If everything looks OK, return logging to normal and restart service via
     the init system.
