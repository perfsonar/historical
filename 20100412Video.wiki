== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees: Maxim, Jeff, Jason, Eric, Andy, Brian, Joe, Ahmed, Marcos, Aaron, Matt
 # Followup on previous actions:
  * _*ACTION*_: Jason/Andy to add more netlogging to LS code
    * Jason: Deployed on some Internet2 hosts. Doesn't look to have helped much. Ahmed will be looking closer.
  * _*ACTION*_: Jason to redeploy nettlogging at Internet2
    * done
  * _*ACTION*_: Andy to redeploy netlogging at ESnet 
    * continue
  * _*ACTION*_: Brian/Eric P to analyze results when available
    * continue
  * _*ACTION*_: Eric P/Andy to look at XMLDB _drop in_ replacements
    * This is longer term and will be tracked on the issue tracker.
  * _*ACTION*_: Marcos/Eric P/Andy should continue investigation into the vmstat results from planetlab to see what is blocking processes.
    * Should look at vmstat along with the netlogger output.
 # pSPT 3.1.3 Release Status
    * RC1 is available and will be tested this week.
 # [InstallDVD_Notes InstallDVD proposal]
    * long rambling discussion with positives/negatives discussed. The short story is that DOE sites would benefit from the ability to patch kernels provided by this functionality and that University sites benefit from the ability to quickly deploy a toolkit on a host non-destructively. Aaron suggested that both could be accomplished by using kick-start functionality instead of the clonezilla solution. Aaron and Eric will explore jointly and propose a development plan to accomplish both.
 
=== ACTIONS ===
  * _*ACTION*_: Ahmed will analyse the LS code to look for places to optimize and look for locking issues.
  * _*ACTION*_: Andy to redeploy netlogging at ESnet 
  * _*ACTION*_: Brian/Eric P to analyze results when available
  * _*ACTION*_: Aaron and Eric will explore jointly and propose a development plan for the next version of the toolkit enabling both R/O media as well as a full-install option.
