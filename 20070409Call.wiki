== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attending: Maxim, Martin, Jason, Joe, Jeff, Matt, Yee, Les, Asif 
 # Team Updates
   # FNAL (Maxim)
     * Not much this week. Will be working on deployment documentation with E2Emon for configuration tool. Wants to work with Jason on a perl SQL MA.
   # UDEL (Martin/Jason)
     * Martin: been working with a student on a more general way to incorporate libxml2 functionality into a server. (apache mod_cgi seems easiest at this point, but globus method is still the goal) Martin has also been working with students to get multi-ls work done by udel-yee resurected. Especially the bdb/exist database comparison work.
     * Jason: been working to integrate the XML::LibXML perl module (that uses libxml2 under the covers) into the pS-PS code base in place of the current perl hash objects. It looks to support all the current things we are doing and allows XPath queries of the DOM objects.
   # Ga Tech (Warren)
     * N/A
   # ESnet (Joe/Mike)
     * Joe: student working on google maps view of network topology elements.
     * ESnet will have workshop to define network 'services' for the future at the end of April. ESnet will be exposing network information using pS interfaces so pS is a likely topic of conversation. ESnet recently hired Jon Duggan to rewrite statistics collection for ESnet.
   # Internet2 (Eric/Jeff)
     * Jeff: Working on simple speedometer GUI over link-untilization MA. Working on software to define 'meshes' of measurement hosts for collecting data from a full set of points. (owamp and bwctl) Eventually will define pS administrative interfaces. Jeff will contact Joe to discuss creating a shared mesh of Internet2/ESnet measurment points for owamp data.
   # SLAC (Yee/Les/Asif)
     * Yee: Working on a google-maps visualization of network. Need:
       * LS registration for Internet2/ESnet services
       * More topology resources
         * Jason and Chris will be be working on pS topology of Internet2 network - update when ready.
     * Les: SLAC has submitted a proposal to work with the Pakastan research network to deploy pS services on their network. (See Les email for additional details.)
   # IU (Luke/Chris)
     * Luke (via email): RRD MA seems to be working. Currently working on auto-update of RRD MA configuration based on changes to the GRNOC database.
 # SOAP/XML parsing status
     * Update (XML::LibXML)
       * Jason will have most code modified to the new method in the next couple of days including updates to the tutorial.
 # pS-PS
     * Any changes others need to be aware of?
       * No
     * Any tutorial feedback?
       * No
     * Any questions from new developers?
       * No
 # RRD Service (Internet2 network deployment)
     * Topic postponed to next week
       * What is needed to make this a 'production' service?
       * Feedback on what is needed to make the software a reasonable distribution for other network administrators.
 # L2 Status (Internet2 network deployment)
     * Topic postponed to next week
        * Current status (IU/Jason)
 # Post-Internet2 network deployments
     * As we get services working, we need to have a few of us concentrating on packaging and deployment/configuration scripts to make them easy to install.
 # Spring Member Meeting
     * Can we show the SLAC analysis/google maps interface interacting with Internet2 RRD MA in Eric's performance update? (Main session)
     * perfSONAR will be used in HOPI demo
       * Jeff will send email to update on the status of this when there is something to show.
         # Deploy RRD MP/MA to grab SNMP utilization for both ends of a HOPI circuit connection.
         # Iperf will generate traffic between two hosts connected to circuit.
         # HOPI/Oscars-BRU/Dragon software will reconfigure the circuit for larger/smaller capacity.
         # Speedometer style web page will interact with RRD MA to show utilization as it changes.
 # Next Meeting: 16 April 07 2:30 US/Eastern
