== Installation and Configuration ==

The following guide describes in detail the steps required to set up the _perfSONAR_ Network Performance Toolkit.  It is important to follow each step in order.  Upon getting stuck, consult the [NPToolkitQuickStart#FAQ FAQ] at the end of this document.  

=== First Steps ===

  # Download the the latest from:
    * [http://www.perfsonar.net/download/bundles/pS-NPToolkit/current.iso]
    * [http://www.perfsonar.net/download/bundles/pS-NPToolkit/current.md5]
  # Verify the MD5 sum:
    * md5sum -c pS-NPToolkit-2.0.iso 
  # Burn the ISO to a CD-ROM
  # Configure the computer to boot from CD
    * This may require changes to the computer's BIOS to ensure the CD is recognized before an existing harddisk
    * The BIOS may be entered when the computer boots by using a key combination (*F12* in some cases, *Del* in others - consult a manual if unsure or pay close attention to the boot process to enter _setup_).  
  # Insert the CD-ROM into the tray and boot the system
    * The computer will boot with some typical messages, after this it will enter the boot and customization process.
      * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_1_boot.png
    * The boot process will proceed after this screen where typical linux startup messages will be seen.
      * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_2_startup.png

=== Console Configuration ===

After the boot process, there will be a menu of options. 

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_3_menu.png

Each step will be explained here with pictures where applicable.  

==== Step 1 ==== 

To properly store configuration information and stored measurement data, a drive must be configured to act as storage.  Normally we would expect the onboard disk to fill this role, but optionally a external drive such as a USB flash device may be used.  There are minimal requirements for the storage:

 * Should be large enough to hold configuration files and measurement data
   * Minimum of a gigabyte for short term use
   * Much larger recommended for long term deployment
 * Should be in the _ext3_ format
   * If the disk is already formatted, the software will use existing space and _*WILL NOT*_ delete or corrupt existing data.
   * If not, there will be an option to format the disk before use.

The following images demonstrate the steps of this particular configuration option.

 * First select a drive to use.  In this example there is only one disk available.
   * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_4_option1_1.png
 * In this screen the option to format was selected.  Note that reboot will be required.
   * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_5_option1_2.png
 * Similar to the previous step, the option to format was not selected (the disk in this case was already readable).  After the saving step the menu will re-appear.
   * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_6_option1_3.png

==== Step 2 ====

There are some basic items that are useful to all services from both a customization point of view (e.g. personalized web pages and menus) as well as a global discovery point of view (e.g. finding specific data for a specific institutions resources).

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_7_option2.png

==== Step 3 ====

There are built in accounts for this installation:

 * _*knoppix*_ - user level permissions
 * _*root*_ - administrator permissions

These accounts must be set before leaving the configuration as they can be a security risk if let untouched.

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_8_option3.png

==== Step 4 ====

All services are enabled by default with the exception of SSH.  This screen allows the administrator to turn off or on services before starting, thus allowing the disk use to be customized for specific circumstances.  The first screen lists the current services (disk defaults).  

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_9_option4_1.png

This is the appearance after enabling SSH.  

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_10_option4_2.png

Note that there are packages available on the disk that are capable of running ssh through kerebos (a requirement of many LHC site installations).  If the installation site has such requirements, ssh may be enabled after some configuration.

==== Step 5 ====

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_19_option7_2.png

==== Step 8 ====

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_20_option8.png

==== Step 9 ====

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_21_option9.png

==== Step 10 ====

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_22_option10_1.png
http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_23_option10_2.png
http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_24_option10_3.png
http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_25_option10_4.png

==== Step 11 ====

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_26_option11.png

==== Post Configuration ====

After exiting the menu, the machine may require a reboot.  

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_27_exit.png

If this is the case, please do so.  When the machine comes back up then simply exit the configuration.  After performing all of these steps and exiting the menu the bootup process will start:
      
http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_28_reboot.png

The user will be faced with a prompt:

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_29_prompt.png

_*knoppix*_ is the default user, with a blank password unless this was changed in [NPToolkitQuickStart#Console_Configuration Step 4].  There are some additional steps that can now be taken to configure some other services, specifically the _perfSONAR_ services. 

=== Web Configuration ===

Once the machine has booted it is now accessible via the static IP or a DHCP address.  To see the address use the */sbin/ifconfig* command from the console:

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_30_ifconfig.png

Once the contact information is known, use a web browser to view the status of the disk, e.g. visit *http://HOST_OR_ADDRESS* or *https://HOST_OR_ADDRESS* (https is the default, and all communication will be redirected there anyway):

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_31_services_cgi.png

There are several GUIs that can be used configure services (note: to do this logging in as the _knoppix_ or other users added in [NPToolkitQuickStart#Console_Configuration Step 4] above is required.  Root _*cannot*_ log in):
 * https://HOST_OR_ADDRESS/admin/pinger
   * Used to configure hosts for the PingER tool
   * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_32_PingER_Start.png
 * https://HOST_OR_ADDRESS/admin/perfsonarbuoy
   * Used to configure hosts for the perfSONAR-BUOY Bandwidth and Latency Tester
   * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_33_pSB_Start.png
 * https://HOST_OR_ADDRESS/admin/cacti
   * Used to configure SNMP Hosts for the perfSONAR SNMP MA
   * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_34_Cacti.png

==== Cacti Configuration ==== 

Please visit [NPToolkitCacti] for complete instructions regarding setting up Cacti for the polling of SNMP enabled network elements.

==== perfSONAR BUOY Configuration ==== 

Please visit [NPToolkitPerfSONARBUOY] for complete instructions on using the perfSONAR-BUOY configuration GUI to manage the scheduled polling of bandwidth and latency hosts.

==== PingER Configuration ==== 

Please visit [NPToolkitPingER] for complete instructions on using the PingER administrative GUI to manage the scheduled latency tests to remote sites.

=== Disk Verification ===

Once the machine has booted it is now accessible via the static IP or a DHCP address.  To see the address use the */sbin/ifconfig* command from the console:

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_30_ifconfig.png

Once he contact information is known, use a web browser to view the status of the disk, e.g. visit *http://HOST_OR_ADDRESS* or *https://HOST_OR_ADDRESS* (https is the default, and all communication will be redirected there anyway):

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_31_services_cgi.png

There are also several GUIs linked directly from this page that can be used to view the status of services:

==== Global Service Directory ==== 

Through the power of the perfSONAR Global Lookup Service (*gLS*) there are several GUIs available on the disk that can be used to display and locate services from around the world (including the newly set up instance after some requisite registration time).  The main interface is _directory.cgi_:

 * View services by category
 * Includes links to GUIs when applicable
 * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_35_Directory.png

Note that both GUIs take advantage of caching techniques to limit the scope and frequency of the information queries: e.g. do not use this as a _real-time_ information source.

====  Cacti ==== 

This is a non-administrative view of cacti data.  This link can be shared with individuals and does not require a username or password.

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_36_Cacti.png

====  PingER ==== 

This GUI can be used to view the data of the on-board PingER instance or that of any other remote service.  Note that this GUI has a lot more power for selecting the time range and data sources than some of the [NPToolkitQuickStart#Service_Test Service Test] tools.

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_37_PingER.png

==== Java Owamp Client ==== 

The Java version of an OWAMP Client (jowping) has a simple interface that can be used to perform owamp tests to the onboard or any other OWAMP server.  

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_38_Java_OWAMP.png

==== NPAD ==== 

In addition to being a performance tool, NPAD features a web interface that can be used to locate the results of past tests.

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_39_NPAD.png

==== NDT ==== 

In addition to being a performance tool, NDT features a web interface that contains other relevant information.

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_40_NDT.png

==== Service Test ==== 

The _serviceTest.cgi_ script is able to test simple perfSONAR tasks to a variety of services; namely the three services included on this disk:

 * perfSONAR-BUOY
   * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_41_pSB.png
 * PingER
   * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_42_PingER.png
 * SNMP MA
   * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_43_SNMP.png
 * Error Condition
   * http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/NPK_44_Error.png
   
== FAQ ==

 * *Q: How do I logon to the console?*
 * *A:* The NPToolkit console is accessed by logging in as the user *_knoppix_*. By default, there is no password for this account and no remote access is allowed.  See instructions in [NPToolkitQuickStart#Console_Configuration Console Configuration] to change details regarding system users, or enable remote access.

 * *Q: How do I get an X-windows environment?*
 * *A:* The NPToolkit was designed for hands-off operations, so it boots into the console mode by default.  For users interested in working in an XWindows environment, [http://www.kde.org KDE] is available.  To bring the system up in X11 mode log in as *_knoppix_*, or any other valid user, and run the _startx_ command.

 * *Q: Where can I ask questions or report bugs?*
 * *A:* 
   * For questions, email to i2-perfsonar _at_ internet2 _dot_ edu
   * For bugs, report at http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/issues/list . Label the bug as "Component-NPToolkit", or state in the bug description the issue involves the NPtoolkit.

 * *Q: How do I configure the SNMP MA?*
 * *A:* The SNMP MA is pre-configured to use the Cacti SNMP collection system. A step by step guide to configuring cacti is available in [NPToolkitCacti].

 * *Q: How do I configure the hosts PingER pings?*
 * *A:* There's an included GUI for configuring the sites PingER should collect ping between. Navigate to https://HOST/admin/pinger/.  With this GUI, add/remove hosts and domains from testing. Press the _Save landmarks_ button when done and restart PingER by logging into the machine and running _sudo /etc/init.d/PingER.sh restart_.  A step by step guide to configuring PingER is available in [NPToolkitPingER].

 * *Q: How do I configure the hosts perfSONAR-BUOY pings?*
 * *A:* There's an included GUI for configuring the sites perfSONAR-BUOY should perform OWAMP/BWCTL tests between. Navigate to https://HOST/admin/perfsonarbuoy/.  With this GUI, add/remove hosts and adjust other testing parameters. Press the _Save_ button when done and restart perfSONAR-BUOY by logging into the machine and running, _sudo /etc/init.d/pSB.sh restart_, _sudo /etc/init.d/pSB_collector.sh restart_ and _sudo /etc/init.d/pSB_master.sh restart_.  A step by step guide to configuration is available in [NPToolkitPerfSONARBUOY].

 * *Q: How do I test that my services are working?*
 * *A:* There is a _self status_ page available on every installation: https://HOST.  Each subsection of the disk features links to GUIs that validate the functionality of the services.
