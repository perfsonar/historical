#summary Support Assignments

= Introduction =

The core NP Toolkit support team has decided to divide up support responsibility as follows.
There will be a primary support person at all times, on a .5 month rotation. This person is responsible for answering support email, and assigning tasks to others if appropriate. If the primary person is unavailable, they are responsible for finding their own replacement.

The current rotation includes: Aaron, Kavitha, Nils, Andy, Sowmya, Brian
(Please volunteer if you'd like to be added to the rotation!)
