#summary Support Assignments

= Introduction =

The core NP Toolkit support team has decided to divide up support responsibility as follows.
There will be two primary support people at all times, on a .5 month rotation. Currently, one will be located in North America and another in Europe to maximize timezone coverage (in the event we add someone to the rotation from another continent we will adjust accordingly). Each person is responsible for answering support email if they can, or assigning tasks to others if appropriate. Each person should make sure that emails are responded to within 1 working day. If a primary person is unavailable, they are responsible for finding their own replacement.

The current rotation includes: 

 * Aaron Brown
 *  Jason Zurawski (Will leave regular rotation at end of 2014)
 * Andy Lake
 * Sowmya Balasubramanian
 * Brian Tierney
 * Dan Doyle
 * Michael Johnson 
 * Ivan Garnizov
 * Rade Martinovic
 * Szymon Trocha
 * Roland Karch
 * Antoine Delvaux
 * John Hicks

(Please volunteer if you'd like to be added to the rotation!)
