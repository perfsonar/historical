#summary Support Assignments

= Introduction =

The core NP Toolkit support team has decided to divide up support responsibility as follows.
There will be a primary support person at all times, on a .5 month rotation. This person is responsible for answering support email, and assigning tasks to others if appropriate. The person should try to respond to emails within 1 working day. If the primary person is unavailable, they are responsible for finding their own replacement.

The current rotation includes: Aaron, Jason, Andy, Sowmya, Brian, Dan, Michael
(Please volunteer if you'd like to be added to the rotation!)
