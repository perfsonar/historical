#summary Support Assignments

= Introduction =

The core NP Toolkit support team has decided to divide up support responsibility as follows.
There will be a primary support person at all times, on a .5 month rotation. This person is responsible for answering support email, and assigning tasks to others if appropriate. The person should try to respond to emails within 1 working day. If the primary person is unavailable, they are responsible for finding their own replacement.

The current rotation includes: 
 * Aaron Brown
 *  Jason Zurawski (Will leave regular rotation at end of 2014)
 * Andy Lake
 * Sowmya Balasubramanian
 * Brian Tierney
 * Dan Doyle
 * Michael Johnson 
 * Ivan Garnizov
 * Rade Martinovic
 * Szymon Trocha
 * Roland Karch
 * Antoine Delvaux
(Please volunteer if you'd like to be added to the rotation!)
