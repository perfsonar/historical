== Notes ==
 * Security Assessment Discussion (Von Welch and Barton Miller)
  * Von on grant to help NSF on cybersecurity
  * Large software development project, but want to minimize work required to keep secure and up-to-date for users
 * Have standard software dev concerns, some of the "appliance" concerns are new ground
 * If box gets compromised, people may not want to lose data
 * Some deployments centrally managed and closely monitored by OSG
 * Main goal is to keep security admins at end sites happy
 * Next steps: Von will evaluate it and get back with suggestions. There might be multiple subprojects:
  # Software dev best practices
  # Keeping appliances safe
  # Walkthrough of vulnerability handling
 * Project Planning 
  * Reviewed spreadsheet
  * Aaron will fill out BWCTL
  * Rade will fill-out PS UI
  * Dan may push out some dates on hardware
 * Stale node
  * Can ask lookup service what versions are
  * Would like to know how much a host is used potentially. Ideas included having bwctl report when a test is run to a central server or getting info on regular tests from MAs
  * Andy complained about using the word "value" and trying to equate that with "staleness" or "how many tests are being run"
 * MaDDash
  * Eric shared that at I2 interested in a way to better visualize sparse meshes. Andy agrees that it would be a good thing to look at in 2.0
