About:
------

The perfSONAR-PS PingER GUI package contains a web applicaiton based on perl's MVC called Catalyst.

PingER GUI relies on an external script to contact the perfSONAR IS
infrastructure.  This optimization prevents the web interface from directly
initiating an active query and flooding the IS with duplicate requests for
information.  The results of this script, which is run through cron a regular
schedule, are then consumed by the GUIs to display a snapshot of the
infrastructure.

PingER GUI has the ability to display  different types of measurement data:
 
 - round trip Latency  
 - inter packet dealys
 - packet loss
 
Installation:
-------------

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions
  
Configuration:
--------------

Additional configuration of this software is not required.  

Starting/Stopping:
------------------

PingER GUI has two "moving parts" that are controlled by external software:

1) Apache httpd controls access to the web frontend

2) cron controls execution of 'pigner_cache.pl', the script that queries the perfSONAR
   IS infrastructure

If you wish to prevent or restrict access to PingER GUI after installation it is
necessary to modify the apache/cron configurations:

1) '/etc/httpd/conf.d/pinger_gui.conf' contains the directive that exposes
   PingER GUI through Apache httpd

2)  '/etc/cron.d/pinger_cache.cron' contains the entry that cron will execute
    regarding the 'pinger_cache.pl' script.

Testing:
--------

After installation visit:

    http://YOURHOST/gui/display

The directory should be viewable (N.B. to alter this disable 'Indexes' in the
'Options' line of '/etc/httpd/conf.d/PingER GUI.conf').  

Note that on first viewing you may not see any data for either of these CGIs,
this is normal.  The 'pinger_cache.pl' program will run every 30 minutes via cron, the
data will be available 30 minutes after installation.

Maintenance:
------------
