 # Attendees: Jason, Brian, Maxim, Aaron, Jared, Les
 # Team Updates
   # Internet2
     * Jason: Working on documentation. dLS document fully converted to docbook, expected completion by group is 1st week of January. Echo/LS Protocol docs expected this week (1st drafts), as well as SNMP MA service documentation. Aaron: Working on packaging services (LS, SNMP MA, Circuit/Status MA, Topology) into CPAN and RPM formats.
   # SLAC
     * Yee is traveling for the holidays. Jared: Working to package PingER, will be looking closely at Aaron's progress.
   # IU
     * N/A
   # FNAL
     * Maxim: Currently testing MA. Working with Jared/Yee on packaging. Working with Aaron to integrate Daemon Architecture. Will be changing web script to work with landmarks file to make the web configuration available (Jan). Would like to schedule a meeting day in Jan to discuss progress.
   # UDEL
     * N/A - Martin is working on dLS and other NMWG documentation. Karthik has prepared a proof of concept Patricia Trie implementation in Java.
   # ESnet
     * N/A
   # LBL
     * Brian is coming up to speed on perfSONAR. Has been playing with SNMP MA and discovered 2 bugs (timeout message formating error, no check for validity of RRD files before opening). Will be working on performance issues.
 # pS-PS (Status)
   * Packaging
     * Aaron is preparing CPAN packages (using Module::Build, Maxim has suggested Module::Install), and RPM packages (CentOS, RHEL5, perhaps Fedora). The RPM packaging also needs a package of DBXML. Finding success using 'DAG' repo to find external software (perl modules, slite, rrdtool, etc). Will still need to distribute via our own reop however.
   * Testing
     * Discussed testing in the overall framework, not necessarily upcoming release. Need to create request/expected response pairs to test protocol in each service, use a tool such as SOAP-UI. Harder to test this interaction via 'make test'. Need simple tests in the CPAN packages to verify correctness of installation.
 # Standards Docs (status)
   * dLS
     * Expected completion by 1st week of January. Coding has already started.
   * LS/Echo/(others) protocol
     * Expected complete before holidays (drafts & skeletons). Will expect group input.
   * Service Level Documentation (SNMP MA/LS)
     * Expected complete before holidays (drafts & skeletons). Will expect group input.
 # pingER MA/MP (Status)
   * Available for download, will be ready to discuss distribution/testing in meeting 2nd week of January.
 # Next call will be Jan 7
