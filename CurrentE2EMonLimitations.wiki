Constructing applications that can query for a circuit's status in parallel is
difficult due to the serial nature of the model. If a circuit traverses domains
A, B and C, the only way to find that the circuit traverses B is to ask domains
A or C.

Tying circuits to underlying infrastructure is difficult due to the use of
generic nodes as the endpoints instead of ports. There may be a number of
individual circuits that transit a given pair of nodes, increasing the
difficulty for clients to correlate which interfaces, or sub-interfaces, on a
given host correspond to which circuits.

The E2EMon schema assumes that all links are bidirectional. This property
limits E2EMon's ability to monitor circuits that follow different paths
depending on the direction.

The E2EMon schema is heavily reliant on circuit naming conventions. These are
used to define sources, destinations and projects.
