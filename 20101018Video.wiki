   * Proposed Changes:
     * Create a package to generate the tarball, and expose it via apache
     * Create a package to download the tarball (LS Cache Daemon does this now?) and store in common location
     * Convert perfAdmin to use the downloaded location, and not run it's own cache via cron
   * People involved?
   * Timelines?
