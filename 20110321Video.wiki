     * Nils and Sowmya will create a vmware image for building contributions for the toolkit.   
       * Doc page up.  Work in progress.  Lots of changes to the image ... doc needs to reflect this.     
       * Running through VMware build image now.  was scripting things, may aviod this.  Has a concern - how to distrubute?  Sort of big.  How big - 2.2G.  Will be stored on main web site.  
   * _*ACTION*_: Jason will continue exploring the non-transaction method for opening xmldb. He will also look into timing the operations to see if this will increase performance as well.
     * no progress
   * _*ACTION*_: Jeff and Brian will look through issue tracker to determine effort level and resources for 3.2.1 tagged items.
     * Met last week.  Pushed off certain thigns before ... Brian and ESnet think we can do more.  Move some things into 3.2.1 and assign resources.  Brian/Jeff to talk w/ developers to estimate work.  
   * _*ACTION*_: Andy will check out SLAC traceroute analysis. 
     * no progress
   * _*ACTION*_: Jason will add a FAQ item regarding mis-matched NIC speeds.
     * no progress - will do a bunch of doc updates at once.  
   * _*ACTION*_: Jeff to figure out how to manage collaborative web space at psps.perfsonar.net. 
     * Meeting w/ internal people.  
   * _*ACTION*_: All: read / comment on  http://fasterdata.es.net/fasterdata/perfSONAR/ps-howto/perfsonar-configuration-guide/ and http://fasterdata.es.net/fasterdata/troubleshooting/overview/
     * Jason sent comments, other should do the same.  
   * _*ACTION*_: Brian will add an issue to deal with 'contributed' drivers and such.
     * not present, held over
   * _*ACTION*_: Andy will create a new owamp summary schema and event type with buckets required.
     * Checked in code.  Updating issue.  Using a special event type now.  Sowmya doing testing?
   * _*ACTION*_: Sowmya will do more performance analysis of XML generation.
     * Set up tests.  Sent some results to people a week or so ago.  DB query is taking some time, lots of data is being returned.  She is looking into speeding up DB queries.  Store data in hashes/perl data structures.  
     * Jeff - what queries is sowmya using for SQL vs what was the original?  Union is not the right way to do it - loop through the tables and build up the data.  
     * Jason - XML output performance, are you doing string concatenation or writing to a file?  She is storing the values in arrays, so its not really string concatenation.  Has some results.  Not a huge performance hit doing it this way - will send out the results.  
 # Developer updates?
   * Andy: Jon Dugan added discards/errors to ESxSNMP.  Store file was huge, really hard to manage.  XPath against this was poor.  Added mdbackend using SQLite.  Re-architect to use this instead?  Future discussion.  
   * Andy: BWCTL/OWAMP MP.  Started doing this.  
 # OSG Monitoring
   * Jason outlines process - OSG needs some monitoring scripts similar to NAGIOS.  We have a proof of concept for the 'LS' status right now.  Need to convert others.
   * May be hard, RSV likes certain cmd line options.  Jason to talk w/ developers about this
   * Andy has some time to help Jason convert one of them (throughput?) in the next week or so.
