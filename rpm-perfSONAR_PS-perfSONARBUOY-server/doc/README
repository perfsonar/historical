				perfSONAR-BUOY

perfSONAR-BUOY is a combination of a scheduled testing framework and perfSONAR
enabled web service capable of delivering the results of these measurements.
Currently, perfSONAR-BUOY is capable of testing with the iperf
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf) bandwidth measurement tool used through
the bwctl tool (http://e2epi.internet2.edu/bwctl/) to invoke, schedule, and
otherwise control the performance measurement component.  

perfSONAR-BUOY consists of the following components:

 - Client
    + bwmaster: 	A script that manages measurements between target machines
    + client:	    A client capable of speaking to perfSONAR services; this is
                    included to aide in debugging
 - Server
    + bwcollector:  A script that collects the results of the measurements from 
                    remote machines
    + bwdp: 	    A helper script to create the necessary database schemata in
                    a MySQL database
    + Web Service:	A 'perfSONAR Powered' service that is able to read the
                    database schema and deliver the results of the scheduled
                    measurements.
 - Config
    + owmesh.conf   The configuration file common to both the client and the
                    server.
