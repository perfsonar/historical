   # Work with Dan to integrate some or all of his scripts into the disk and integrate the q+a that's been added to the disk into his framework. (*MOSTLY DONE*)

   # Port master/collector to perfSONAR (w/ JZ)
   # Latency Star Abstraction
     * powstream modification

     # pSB Configuration GUIs
     # gLS integration into the services.cgi (e.g. perfAdmin improvements)
     # Testing Coordination

     * Try to _do it wrong_ so we can identify where we are not clear
   # Testing in AA
     # Verify we can access saved info
     # Verify 'upgrades' are smooth, can access existing measurement data
   # bwctl release (perhaps some documentation - edit passes for sure)

 * Jeff
   # bwctl documentation

 * Not Yet Claimed (for discussion during perf-team meeting)
   # Ability to pull down 'centralized' configuration and merge with host config ([ISOAtlasCentralConfig see problem statement]).
