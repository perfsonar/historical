     # pSB Configuration GUIs
     # gLS integration into the services.cgi (e.g. perfAdmin improvements)
     # Testing Coordination

        * ESnet (I can coordinate Brian/Joe/Jon)

     * Flow of bootup/save procedures
     * Document process to create disk
   # Installation Instructions
     * Improve on existing, try to cover all cases
     * Try to _do it wrong_ so we can identify where we are not clear
   # Testing in AA
     # Verify we can access saved info
     # Verify 'upgrades' are smooth, can access existing measurement data
   # work with Joe to create a version of ls-registration that can maintain a list of 'ping-able' hosts for LHC 
   # bwctl release (perhaps some documentation - edit passes for sure)
