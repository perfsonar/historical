== Overview ==

perfSONAR is an effort to create a collection of easy to use and easy to 
install perfSONAR services. These services will be targeted directly at 
network administrators. The tools should be created using tools that most 
network administrators are comfortable working with. As such, the first 
services created from this project will be written in perl.

Anyone interested in working on this project should contact our mailing list.
