== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees:
 # Team Updates
   # UDEL
   # Ga Tech
   # ESnet
   # Internet2
   # SLAC
   # IU
   # FNAL
 # pS-PS
   * Anything new in the infrastructure portions?
   * SVN structure (package management issues/concerns)
   * TracerouteMP
   * SQL Schema Discussion
     * Current SQL support is limited to:
     * my @dbSchema = ("id", "time", "value", "eventtype", "misc");
     * Is this reasonable for all datatypes? What ways would it need to extend? Is Class::DBI a possible way to extend it?
   * Threads, Processes, Async-IO
     * Maxim points out that Perl DBI is not thread-safe. Also, thread support in perl is somewhat lacking anyway. Currently, it would be trivial to change the code to a classic accept-fork loop. We would also need to fork for the different pieces of functionality (MA/MP/LS-reg). The other piece we would need to add is some kind of waitpid/master process. (Jeff already has code for this in the AMI distribution.) Is thread-safety an important enough reason to do this? For some services, we might actually want to deal with async-IO and work-que threads for performance reasons. (The LS comes to mind.)
 # Standards docs
   * namespace mismatches and other inconsistencies need to be addressed in an authoritative document. The OGF document will lay the foundation, but more specific 'profile' documents will be required. How much should this group be involved in defining them?
 # RRD Service (Internet2 network deployment)
 # pS-Topo Service / L2 Status MA for Internet2 network
   * status update
 # Follow up on LHC-OPN support, requirements, priorities
