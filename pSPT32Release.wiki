New issues from Milestone Live CD 1:

|| *Issue* || *Synopsis* || *Status* ||
|| ~~Spash screen version number~~ || fixed || <font color="green">_*DONE*_</font> ||
|| ~~Error on boot 'cannot remove /var/run/web_admin/sessions is a directory'~~ || fixed || <font color="green">_*DONE*_</font> ||
|| ~~Surpress mount, eth errors on boot~~ || fixed || <font color="green">_*DONE*_</font> ||
|| ~~User doesn't get a home directory on log in "Could not chdir to home directory /home/zurawski: No such file or directory".  This was after configuring the backing store, users, and then being forced to reboot~~ || Reboot forced, warning errors || <font color="green">_*DONE*_</font> ||
|| ~~After enabling ssh, and trying to ssh to the host: "PTY allocation request failure on channel 0.  could not chdir to /home/zurawski" then freeze.~~ || fixed || <font color="green">_*DONE*_</font> ||
|| Post-install log in /root || will fix before release || <font color="red">_*NOT STARTED*_</font> ||
|| ~~The create_backing_store wasn't reading /proc/partitions properly. Wouldn't mount the device unless blkid said it was ext3.~~ || fixed || <font color="green">_*DONE*_</font> ||
|| empty resolve.conf, domino effect to the LS cache daemon and NTP || watching for other instances || <font color="red">_*NOT STARTED*_</font> ||
|| LS Cache - won't need to 'update' this before release due to new cache service || TBD || <font color="red">_*NOT STARTED*_</font> ||
|| weirdness with the disk configuration script.  If the disk has no partition info (but had an ext3 fs on it before the partition table was wiped), the script detects the raw device with 'unknown' partition type. || The script uses "blkid" to figure out the FS type, and there seem to be some combination of partition voodoo that prevents blkid from recognizing proper ext3 partitions. The only way to truly figure out whether it's ext3 or not is to try and mount the partition.  Need a FAQ entry || <font color="red">_*NOT STARTED*_</font> ||
|| ~~I select that disk and it asks me to format, I say 'no'.  Then it goes ahead to try and save the config info anyway (and succeeds!).  When I go back to reconfigure, the disk now shows 'ext3'.  In /mnt/store.new it creates NPTools dir.  When I repeat the steps above, there's just a NPTools.back dir.  At reboot, no config is restored at this point.~~ || Fixed || <font color="green">_*FIXED*_</font> ||
|| TBD || TBD || <font color="red">_*NOT STARTED*_</font> ||
