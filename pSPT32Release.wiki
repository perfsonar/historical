 * Build kickstart file that installs all of the RPMs from the repository - <font color="yellow">_*In PROGRESS*_</font>
 * Update the RPMs if needed (e.g. dependencies not accounted for or similar) - <font color="yellow">_*In PROGRESS*_</font>
 * Start internal testing of alpha kickstart - <font color="red">_*NOT STARTED*_</font>

=== Milestone 3 ===

|| *Summary* || Add the Web GUI to the Toolkit  ||
|| *Status* || <font color="yellow">_*IN PROGRESS - 5/28*_</font> ||
