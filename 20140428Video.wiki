== Notes ==
 * Developer Updates
   * Andy
    * Finished esmond docs
    * Worked on LS reg proposal
    * Debugged bwctl with aaron
    * Various POW things
   * Michael

    * worked on graphing. see later. 
   * Brian
    * Spent some time with cubox and have fedora working
    * Asked Monte to start looking at GridFTP log feeder
   * Sowmya
    * Testing ps-east and ps-west sLS 
   * Aaron
    * Debugging issues on bwctl
    * First issue, RNG was not getting seeded correctly so stuff getting restarted at same time could be problematic
    * Results were taking too long to come back because of new 10 second timeout to prevent bwctl from finishing. Increased to 60 sec and gave to Andy
    * Discussion about send and receive side info provided by bwctl. Conclusion was best way would be for iperf3 to share interval info for both sides.
    * Playing with Cacti scripts to do NTP. Has graph, but not sure stats are right
    * Looking at source-based routing. Works in Ipv4 but not Ipv6. Maybe we should say we just support interfaces on different subnets?
   * Jason
    * Call with CARnet about interesting VPN case
    * CCINE workshop this week and giving perfsonar talks    
 * MA LS Registration Proposal (Andy)
  * https://code.google.com/p/esnet-perfsonar/wiki/NewMALSRegistrations
  * Aaron suggested change source and destination to source-address and destination-address to allow for possibility of other fields in the future
  * I was noted that its also possible to register domains and communities for a test 
  * Other than that looks good.
 * MA Backward compatibility
  * We have already adapted Nagios to talk to both, working on adapting graphs
  * The question is do we need a translation interface that accepts SOAP and maps to esmond?
  * Group decided it would be best if we ask about clients not already out there. Andy will draft email for approval by group.
 * new graphs for new MA, design and functionality
  * Lots of things we want
  * Conclusion: Get current graphs working with esmond by RC1, for RC2 try to get brand new graphs
 * cacti and NTP monitoring
  * See Aaron report
