=== Bugs Related to This Release ===

Due to the time constraints placed on release team members, the Joint Techs Conference (Mid July 2009) was used as a dividing line: most critical functionality should be ready before a first RC followed by a short period of time used to close any remaining bugs and test the final products.

=== Code Reviews ===

The code _review_ can be a lot more in depth than just reading in suggesting.  Most corrections can be done directly to the code base to save time in the process.  Reviewers are encouraged to run [Perltidy] and [Perlcritic] at the end of the review.  

Things to think about as you review:

 * Perldoc:
   * Is there a footer on each script/module?
     * License info
     * Contact Info
     * Related libraries
     * API use (where applicable)
   * Is there a header on each script/module?
     * Are the names and information correct?
   * Does each method have a function header
     * Does it describe inputs and outputs as well as expected behaviour
 * Library Use - Examine each external library dependency
   * Is it necessary to use the library (e.g. does the use justify including the dependency)
   * Could the library be ommited (provide suggestions how)
 * Code Structure
   * See the [CodeRules rules of the code]
 * Design decisions
   * Question why things are organized/designed they way they are in a constructive fashion.  Developers will be happy to hear the commentary
 * Function/Module Size
   * Make constructive comments regarding excessively large or small modules and functions.  Note that ware trying to make a sound object oriented piece of software.
 * Test Cases
   * Ensure test cases for unit testing are appropriate in both structure and quantity
   * Ensure test cases for test harness are appropriate in both structure and quantity

See the [pSPSReleaseManagement#Code_Review Code Review] section from the other document for more information.  The reviews should be shared with the entire group (use the mailing list).  

=== Documentation Reviews ===

Documentation review is a review of included and posted documentation for errors and omissions.  It may help to physically install the software when following installation instructions, etc.

Thinks to think about as you review:

 # In the _*doc/*_ directory:
   * _*INSTALL*_ - Complete for all types of installs (svn, tar package, RPM).  Handles prerequisite information (e.g. yum repo maintenance) 
   * _*Changes*_ - List of changes since the last release where applicable
   * _*README*_ - Configuration and test information meant to supplement _*INSTALL*_.  Should also be complete and may point to other (web) resources
   * _*LICENSE*_ - Updated for this release (e.g. copyright dates, all parties are mentioned).  
   * Others?
 # _*perldoc*_ in each module/script
   * Does each module have the necessary header/footer?  Are they correct and up to date (including copyright dates, modules used, authors.
   * Does each function of a header?  Does it describe in basic terms what the function does?  Do not worry about parameters/return values for this release.
   * Is the doc readable when using _*perldoc*_?
   * Spelling/grammar errors
 # Other documentation (e.g. _*user guides*_)
   * Updated for the most recent release?
   * Spelling/grammar error free
   * Reads well - not too technical and should be useful for the most basic user
   * Complete (e.g. no blank sections, addresses all functionality)

=== Testing ===

Developers are responsible for testing their code:

 * Designing and running unit tests
   * Address all modules
   * Address all methods
   * Test methods for multiple inputs (good and bad)
   * Generate supporting materials (databases, etc.)
   * Frequently run these tests after bugfixes and development
 * Designing and running the test harness to simulate black box activity
   * Design and provide numerous messages and expected responses
   * Frequently run these tests after bugfixes and development
