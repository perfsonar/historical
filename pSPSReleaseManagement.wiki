== Introduction ==

The perfSONAR-PS release process is based heavily on the [ReleaseManagement generic] process.  This page recommends actions for the perfSONAR-PS group only.  Content subject to change, so please review frequently.

== Release Frequency ==

perfSONAR-PS will be released on a bi-yearly basis to coincide with major activities of group members.  We are currently aiming to release:

 * Late Winter - February/March
 * Late Summer - August/September

These suggestions were based on group feedback from the [20081211Video December 11th Call], dates may be shifted based on priorities of the released software or group members.

=== v0.10 Release ===

For more information regarding this release, please see the information [pSPS20090327Release page].

== Release Process ==

The following are recommendations and deviations from the release process [ReleaseManagement#Release_Process recomendations].  These are not set in stone and may be relaxed depending on requirements for a given attempt.  Many are subject to availability of resources (time and manpower).  

=== Dependencies ===

perfSONAR-PS has dependencies on the following software components in Internet2 and related partners:

 * _*OWAMP*_
   * Used by the perfSONAR-BUOY product.  In the event perfSONAR-BUOY is not being released this restraint can be relaxed. 
 * _*BWCTL*_
   * Used by the perfSONAR-BUOY product.  In the event perfSONAR-BUOY is not being released this restraint can be relaxed. 
 * _*DCN*_
   * The OSCARS MA, TL1 Collection, and Status services may be effected by a DCN release.  Each of these can coordinate with the DCN development team prior to a release to ensure compatibility.
 * _*Phobeus*_
   * Phoebus will begin to use perfSONAR-based host monitoring as well as network measurements.  This is not a hard requirement, but prior to a release the Phoebus development team must be consulted.  
 * _*Performance Node*_
   * This software will normally be released *after* perfSONAR-PS to take full advantage of all new features and bugfixes

Prior to a release cycle each of these should be weighed to gauge the importance they may hold in a new product vs. a previously tested release.

=== Revision Control ===

perfSONAR-PS will continue to use subversion.  As [ReleaseManagement#Revision_Control recommended], the release manager will be in charge of SVN wrangling with regards to:

 * Creating the release branch
 * Creating tags for candidates
 * Deleting unused tags and branches when necessary
 
Developers are reminded to work in the appropriate area and merge changes back to trunk promptly.  

=== Schedule ===

See the original [ReleaseManagement#Schedule recommendations].  The schedule allows for a 3 week window, and may be relaxed or tightened on the discretion of the release team.

=== Documentation ===

Developers should focus on documentation for the perfSONAR-PS project in the following order:

 * Perldoc for all modules and scripts
 * Installation and usage documentation (included in packaging)
 * Wiki pages to describe Installation and usage
 * Wiki pages for API use or other examples that may be helpful for users and other developers
 
The release team should be sure to:

 * Provide the technical writing and communications staff updates for the static web pages
 * Ensure the web pages are addressed within a week of the official release

All documentation will be reviewed prior to the release for completeness and correctness.  

=== Testing ===

All perfSONAR-PS modules and applicable scripts must provide:

 * Perl tests at the *_unit_* level
   * These should be written in the typical language of perl tests
   * Test each method several times for a given module/script/api
   * Use automated means when possible to generate databases/files/external relationships
 * Request and Response messages for use in the perl testing framework
   * Each request/response pair should test for an external aspect of the service in question
   * The response should be treated as the _expected_ value, in the absence of a response please provide commentary on what the response should contain
   * Tests should attempt to test both the errors and expected behaviours of the system from the outside.  

=== Code Review ===

Before release each service must go through a code review from a developer or developers. This scope of this code review will be determined prior to each release, but general considerations are:

 * Soundness of design
 * Conformity to the [CodeRules rules of the code]
 * Documentation completeness/sensibility
 * Use of external modules/libraries
 * Construction of adequate test cases
 * Final [http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/ perltidy] and [http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic/bin/perlcritic perlcritic] evaluation

=== Issue Tracker ===

The release manager will:

 * Enter new tags to the issue tracker prior to a release
 * Re-classify all bugs as necessary
 * Annoy the developers to fix/close bugs before and after each release

== Released Product ==

perfSONAR-PS will be released as:

 * Source packages (e.g. similar to what CPAN requires using [http://perldoc.perl.org/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.html Make::Maker])
 * [CreatingPackages RPM Packages]

An associated [YumRepository Yum repository] will be available with all releases of perfSONAR-PS software in addition to the source packages. This tool will enable easier installation and usage within the performance monitoring community.

Special consideration to other types of released packages (FreeBSD ports, Debian packages) will be considered but rarely supported by the core perfSONAR-PS developers.
