#summary Description and Project Plan for the new Lookup Service

= Introduction =

ESnet is developing a new lookup service to replace current perfSONAR-PS lookup service. This new LS, called the sLS (simple Lookup Service), is modelled after the UNIS component of [https://github.com/GENI-GEMINI/GEMINI/wiki/GEMINI-Components GEMINI], developed at Indiana University for the GENI project.
