#JET perfSONAR Demonstration Project

= Introduction =

The [http://www.nitrd.gov/subcommittee/lsn/jet/index.html  Joint Engineering Team (JET)] is coordinating
a perfSONAR Demonstration project.  The goal of this project is to better understand the
issues with deploying multi-domain network measurement services in US federal and research networks.
 

= Participants =

ESnet

NOAA
NLR
UEN

= Goals = 

Some of the goals of this demonstration project are to understand the issues with:
  * Deploying open collaboration software in the different types of organizations.
  * The security issues related to allowing tests across domain boundaries.
  * The policy issues related to sharing/publishing network measurement results.

= Measurement Plan =

  * Each domain will deploy a small number of test points at locations of interest to the other parties.
  * Every domain will collect measurements between themselves and the other participants.
  * Every domain will publish the measurement results they collect.

Note that since every domain is scheduling tests to the other participants, there will actually 
be 2 sets of measurements between every pair, The primary difference is that each set is 
owned and managed by a different domain.

== Latency ==

  * Each test latency test system will be configured to run tests to all other latency testers.
  * The tests will use OWAMP.
  * Each test will be configured at a rate of 10 packets per second.
 
Note that the data set collected by the latency test systems primary value is as a 
measure of availability, as well as providing insight to queuing behaviour and path
changes. 


== Bandwidth ==

  * Each bandwidth tester will run a 30 second TCP test to all other testers once an hour.
