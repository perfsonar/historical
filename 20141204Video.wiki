  * Action: Everyone will normalize smartsheet with time set to "developer days" and not worry about dates at this point. This needs to be done by start of work day on Monday.
   * If you do not have access to smartsheet, click on the link Soraya sent and click the button to request access
  * Security talk needs to be re-scheduled from next week to a later date. Preference is for after the 1st of the year, but if that does not work we will fallback to the 18th.
