== Agenda/Minutes ==

# UDP Status on the KOI systems
    * Brian and Aaron each reported on some testing they had done, but there was nothing definitive yet. Brian will put FreeBSD on two back-to-back KOI systems. Aaron will put the Knoppix on two back-to-back Dell systems. With that information we can hopefully determine if this is OS related, or KOI hardware related.

# Tech Report Status
    * NSF should be credited on the tech-report
    * It is no problem to liberally take from the tech-report for the CHEP paper.


# Test Plan
    * From memory review of the Test Plan. No changes requested.

# RequirementsForCGI
    * Light discussion on what would be desirable for IS related GUIs.
    * hLS/gLS issues discussion
        * Some discussion of how new measurements will go into the hLS/gLS cloud along with current technical limitations that require all namespaces to be known in advance.

# Release Management
    * Need to set timeline.
        * Aiming for a final release of the Knoppix before SMM.
        * Jeff/Jason will work on a timeline with that aim.
    * Features for next release
        * pS-B with OWAMP support
        * gLS/hLS performance updates
        * gLS/hLS GUIs
        * CircuitMon (GLIF version)
        * minimal-config knoppix
    * Will attempt to organize a 'regionals' as betatesters
    * Will likely need a version to support telepresence
