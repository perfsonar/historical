#summary Description of the BWCTL 2.0 Protocol

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= BWCTL 2.0 Protocol =

== Overview ==
BWCTL 2.0 has a REST-ish protocol that is used to schedule a network
measurement between two servers. 

There are 3 entities involved in a BWCTL test: the BWCTL client, the BWCTL A
server and the BWCTL B server. The BWCTL client is the entity that requests the
two servers perform the test, and retrieves the results from the servers. The
BWCTL sender server and BWCTL receiver server are the two servers that perform
the test between themselves. The BWCTL servers will each verify that the
other's test definition matches their own definition, and that their times are
not too far offset. The BWCTL servers will perform the requested test amongst
each other, and make the results available for the client.

== BWCTL Test Scheduling Protocol ==
=== Overview ===
The BWCTL client retrieves the server status from both BWCTL servers, and makes
sure that the server times aren't too far offset, that the test being requested
is possible, and what version of the protocol each server speaks.

The BWCTL client requests a test from the BWCTL A server. The server either
rejects the test, or accepts the test, and assigns it a time slot. The BWCTL
client requests the same test, with the new time slot, from the BWCTL B server.
The BWCTL B server either rejects the test, or accepts the test, possibly
assigning it a new time slot. If the BWCTL B server rejects the test, the bwctl
client cancels the test on the BWCTL A server. If the BWCTL B server changes
the time of the test, or changes it's parameters, the BWCTL client submits the
changes to the BWCTL A server, who can either accept or reject the changes, or
assign it a different time, or other parameters. This back and forth continues
until either both servers agree on the time, and parameters, or the test has
been deemed impossible given time/parameter constraints.

Once both servers have agreed on the time and parameters, the client updates
the test on each server to say that it accepts the test. At this point, each
server connects to the other server and verifies that the test they've accepted
matches the test that was accepted on the other server, and that their time
isn't too far offset from the other server's time. The servers each set their
test statuses to accepted, and then check the remote side to make sure that it
has accepted the test as well.

After the two servers have both verified and accepted the test parameters, they
perform the requested test at the requested time. The client polls the servers
until either side finishes. If one side ended in failure, it should cancel the
test on the other side, but can let the other side finish up on its own. As
each server finishes, the client retrieves the results from that server.

=== Example ===

In the following example, there are 3 entities: the client, server 1 (192.168.0.2) and server 2 (10.0.0.2). 

The client does an HTTP GET request to Server 1 at {{{http://192.168.0.2/bwctl/status}}}. 

Response:
{{{
{
    "version": 2.0.1,
    "protocol": 2.0,
    "time": "2014-11-18T06:37:03.5678Z",
    "ntp_error": 1.2,
    "available_tools": [ "iperf", "iperf3", "nuttcp", "traceroute", "tracepath", "paris-traceroute", "owamp", "ping" ]
}
}}}

The client verifies that server 1 has the tools it needs, and that server 1's clock isn't too far offset.

The client does an HTTP GET request to Server 2 at {{{http://10.0.0.2/bwctl/status}}}.

Response:
{{{
{
    "version": 2.0.1,
    "protocol": 2.0,
    "time": "2014-11-18T06:37:04.12345Z",
    "ntp_error": 0.5,
    "available_tools": [ "iperf", "iperf3", "nuttcp", "traceroute", "tracepath", "paris-traceroute", "owamp", "ping" ]
}
}}}

The client verifies that server 2 has the tools it needs, and that server 2's clock isn't too far offset.

The client does an HTTP POST request to {{{http://192.168.0.2/bwctl/tests}}}.

Request:

    }
}
}}}

The server checks its time, and the client's time, and makes sure they're not too far offset. It then schedules the test, and assigns it an id and a test port number.

Response:

Server 2 verifies that the "server_status" on Server 1's test is set to
'accepted'. If it is not, server 2 periodically retries until it does.

The client periodicly retrieves the tests from each server until both are
'accepted'. It then waits for the test to finish. It may periodicly retry to
catch failures early.

At the accepted time, Server 2 (the receiver) spawns an OWAMP server that
listens on the specified test port (5044). Server 1 (the sender) then spawns an
OWAMP client that connects to the OWAMP server. Once the test ends, each side
sets its test status to "finished", and records the results for the test.

The client does an HTTP GET request to Server 1 to see if there are results at {{{http://192.168.0.2/bwctl/tests/824b8c78-66ae-11e4-9011-001b214e9203/results}}}.
