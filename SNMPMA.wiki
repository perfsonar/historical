#summary perfSONAR-PS SNMP MA Service Information

<wiki:toc max_depth="6" />

== Introduction ==

The [http://www.internet2.edu/performance/pS-PS/ perfSONAR-PS] SNMP based
Measurement Archive (SNMP MA) is able to expose data collected via variables
from the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) protocol found on networked
devices and stored in [http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/ Round Robin Databases]
(RRD) archives. The measurements are collected through external means, normally
through software such as [http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/ MRTG],
[http://www.cacti.net CACTI], or [http://cricket.sourceforge.net/ Cricket], and
is commonly stored in RRD archives. External access to commonly requested data
items, remains challenging due to physical and political boundaries.

The SNMP MA provides a simple interface that is cable of exposing these files
after basic configuration for consumption by
[http://www.perfsonar.net/ perfSONAR] client applications and services alike.
The Web Service front end provides a uniform method of access using the
perfSONAR XML protocols and delivers the data in an unambiguous manner, thus
eliminating the mystery associated with the backend storage. 

== Installation ==

There are several ways to install this service, the popular methods are listed
below.  Note that these are from the point of view of installing a particular
version - this may or may not be the most recent.  

=== Prerequisites ===

The SNMP MA is packaged as an [http://www.rpm.org/ RPM] - a binary installation
format that is geared towards use on Red Hat linux based systems.  Examples
include [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora],
[http://www.redhat.com/ Red Hat Enterprise Linux], [http://centos.org/ CentOS],
[http://www.whiteboxlinux.org/ White Box],
[https://www.scientificlinux.org/ Scientific Linux], and others.  

These Linux distributions normally rely on _Package Management_ tools to install
and maintain software.  Examples of these tools include
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up2date up2Date], [http://yum.baseurl.org/ YUM],
and [http://apt-rpm.org/ APT-RPM].  [http://internet2.edu/ Internet2] has
created a repository to house the perfSONAR-PS software, related performance
tools, and hard to find prerequisites.  We encourage adopters of these tools to
install a simple RPM package that gives the necessary configuration information
for the YUM and APT-RPM tools.  The RPM can be found here:

{{{
wget -c http://software.internet2.edu/Internet2-repo-0.1-2.noarch.rpm
}}}
  
To install this RPM first import the signing key:

{{{
rpm --import http://software.internet2.edu/rpms/RPM-GPG-KEY-Internet2
}}}

Then install the RPM:

{{{
rpm -ivh Internet2-repo-0.1-2.noarch.rpm
}}}

It is also recommended that an additional repository be installed for hard to 
find prerequisite software that may not be available in traditional repositories
used by the Linux distributions.  Two regarded repositories are:

 * http://dries.ulyssis.org/rpm/
 * http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/
 
Each site provides configuration instructions and packages similar to the
Internet2 repository.

==== Other Forms of Linux ====

If using a package management system is not an option, or if your system is not
RedHat based (e.g. Debian, Gentoo, etc.) it is still possible to install this
software and related requirements by hand.  Please see the
[SNMPMA#Tar_Package TarPackage] or [SNMPMA#Subversion Subversion] sections for
more details.  This tool uses the following Perl libraries, libraries, and
external tools to function:


 * Perl Libraries
   * Config::General
   * Cwd
   * DBI
   * Data::UUID
   * Date::Manip
   * Digest::MD5
   * Error
   * Exporter
   * File::Basename
   * File::Temp
   * Getopt::Long
   * HTTP::Daemon
   * IO::File
   * LWP::Simple
   * LWP::UserAgent
   * Log::Dispatch
   * Log::Dispatch::FileRotate
   * Log::Log4perl
   * Module::Load
   * Net::Ping
   * Params::Validate
   * RRDp
   * Socket
   * Sys::Hostname
   * Time::HiRes
   * XML::LibXML
 * Libraries
   * LibXML2
 * Tools
   * RRDTool

=== YUM ===

Like Apt, YUM installation also manages the task of finding dependencies.  The
following command is all that is needed:

{{{
yum install perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1-1.pSPS.noarch.rpm
}}}

There may be several prerequisites to install depending on the age of your
system.  To ensure that all are found, please be sure to install one of the
alternative repositories above. 


=== APT-RPM === 

Installation through APR-RPM is easy, simply let the package manager do the work of
managing the dependencies:

{{{
apt-get update
apt-get install perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1-1.pSPS.noarch.rpm
}}}

There may be several prerequisites to install depending on the age of your
system.  To ensure that all are found, please be sure to install one of the
alternative repositories above.  

=== Standalone RPM ===

If you do not wish to install the Internet2 Repository package, you may simply
find the appropriate RPM for your architecture without using a package manger.
The first step is to install the signing key:

{{{
rpm --import http://software.internet2.edu/rpms/RPM-GPG-KEY-Internet2
}}}

Next download the service, for example if you are on an _*i386*_ architecture:

{{{
wget -c http://software.internet2.edu/rpms/i386/main/RPMS/perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1-1.pSPS.noarch.rpm
}}}
  
To install without package manager help:

{{{
rpm -ivh perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1-1.pSPS.noarch.rpm
}}}
  
Note that this RPM may need packages to install correctly: if they are not found
on your system manual download and install will be required.  An alternate
method is to still use a package manager in a _local_ way (YUM only):

{{{
yum localinstall perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1-1.pSPS.noarch.rpm
}}}

This will still search the available repositories for any necessary packages.

=== Tar Package ===

All RPM packages are also available in _source_ packages that may be installed
and used in the typical Unix/Linux fashion.  There are helper scripts included
that may be used to download the necessary prerequisite software packages:

{{{
wget -c http://software.internet2.edu/source/perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1-1.tar.gz
tar -zxfv perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1-1.tar.gz
make install
cd perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1-1/scripts
./prepare_environment.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
}}}

These two included scripts will configure the machine's users and startup
scripts as well as contact [http://search.cpan.org CPAN] for any necessary perl
libraries.  

In addition to perl requirements, there are other software requirements that
should be installed.  These are not controlled via the dependency scripts due to
differences in package management.  The tools are listed below:

 * RRDTool
   * Source is available [http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/ here]
   * Package management names:
     * Debian/Ubuntu: rrdtool, librrd2, librrd2-dev, librrds-perl, librrdp-perl
     * RedHat Systems: rrdtool, rrdtool-devel, perl-rrdtool
 * LibXML2
   * Package management names:
     * Debian/Ubuntu: libxml2, libxml2-dev, libxml2-utils
     * RedHat Systems: libxml2, libxml2-devel

=== Suggested Configuration Changes ===

The SNMP MA comes with a base configuration via the installation procedure.
This is meant to allow for immediate testing as well as serve as a guide for
customizing the service.  

There are several files that may be adjusted manually to configure this service
for a specific use case:

==== Daemon Changes ====

Contains information that identifies the service uniquely and allows it to run
in a given environment.  There are several options that should be changed:  
   
 * _*service_accesspoint*_ - Change the _hostname_ from _*localhost*_
 * _*service_description*_ - Identifying information about the service
 * _*service_name*_ - Service Name (short)  
 * _*rrdtool*_ - location of the rrdtool binary

There are also several options that may be changed for a configuration:

 * _*port*_ - Port the service listens on
 * _*endpoint*_ - Endpoint to contact the service
 * _*ls_registration_interval*_ - How often to contact gLS, 180 minute (3hr)
 * _*default_resolution*_ - Raise higher or lower depending on RRD files
 * _*metadata_db_external*_ - Used with external tools (Cacti/Cricket)
 * _*enable_registration*_ - Turn on or off LS registration
    
The rest of the items are normally not to be adjusted.
        
==== Logging Changes ====

Contains information related to logging, there are three modes:

 * _*Log::Dispatch::Screen*_ - Log messages to screen (useful for debugging)
 * _*Log::Dispatch::Syslog*_ - Log messages to syslog facility
 * _*Log::Dispatch::FileRotate*_ - Log messages to specified file

The rest of the items are normally not to be adjusted.
    
==== Metadata Configuration Changes ====

The metadata configuration is stored at:

{{{
/var/lib/perfsonar/snmp_ma/store.xml: 
}}}

This file represents the _explanation_ of the data that is being offered by the
service.  It is written in XML and is configured for a _*localhost*_ environment
with a single empty RRD file.  This file may be modified by hand to add new
existing RRD files that describe specific interfaces.  It is also possible to
configure your service to use external collection tools such as Cacti or Cricket.
    
== Service Control ==

The service comes with init scripts that may be used to start and stop
operation:

{{{
/etc/init.d/snmp_ma start
/etc/init.d/snmp_ma stop
/etc/init.d/snmp_ma restart
}}}

The service can also be run in a manual fashion (useful for debugging):

{{{
perl bin/daemon.pl --verbose --conf=etc/daemon.conf --logger=etc/daemon_logger.conf
}}}
  
Before doing this, be sure to [SNMPMA#Logging_Changes edit] the logging to enable
_Screen_ debugging.

== Service Validation ==

The service comes with a client application and several test messages that can
be used to test functionality.  There are many messages provided as examples, 
to test the service there are four that are recommended:

{{{
etc/requests/EchoRequest.xml
etc/requests/MetadataKeyRequest-1.xml 
etc/requests/DataInfoRequest-1.xml 
etc/requests/SetupDataRequest-1.xml
}}}

These four will test the major functions of this service. To test:

 # Ensure the service is started, it helps if you have configured logging to use the "Screen" so you may monitor the service's activities.
 # Run the client:
{{{  
  perl bin/client.pl URL FILENAME
}}}  
 # Compare the results of the test with the comments in each file.  Note there may be some differences (e.g. id values, key values).  
 # If everything looks OK, return logging to normal and restart service via the init system.  

== Service Maintenance ==
