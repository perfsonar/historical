At the top-level of the repository trunk, there are individual directories for each service, and a directory named "Shared".

= The Service Directories =

{{{
perfSONAR_PS-LS
perfSONAR_PS-PingER
perfSONAR_PS-perfSONARBUOY
perfSONAR_PS-SNMP_MA
perfSONAR_PS-Status
perfSONAR_PS-LSRegistrationDaemon
perfSONAR_PS-TopologyService
}}}

Each of those directories has bin, lib, etc, doc and script directories. The configuration files, documentation init scripts, modules and daemon scripts associated with these services will be placed in this directory. This service directory forms the basis for that service's packages.

The lib directory for that package will have all the perfSONAR-PS modules that it depends on. By giving each service its own full lib directory, it removes any shared dependencies between the perfSONAR-PS services. This allows users to upgrade their services independently without having to upgrade the shared dependencies.

= The "Shared" Directory =

perfSONAR-PS has a large number of modules that are shared across multiple services. To prevent having numerous duplicate copies of these files, there's another top-level directory "Shared". This directory has bin, lib, etc, doc and
script directories like the service directories. Any files that might be shared between the services will be placed in these directories.

The relevant files can then symlinked into the service directories. To facilitate this symlinking, there is a script "package_dependencies.pl" which will read the MANIFEST file, and symlink the required modules.

= Branching/Tagging A Release =

To branch or tag a new release, decide which services are going to be released, and copy those services' service directories, along with the "Shared" directory to the new branch or tag.
