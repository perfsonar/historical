=head1 NAME

perfSONAR_PS::Error_compat

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A module that provides a transition between a full on exceptions framework for
perfSONAR PS and having each service specify explicitly the eventType and
description.  This module provides a simple method for throwing exceptions that
look similar to how eventType/description messages used to be propogated.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # if an error occurs, perfSONAR_PS objects should throw an error eg
  sub openDB {
    my $handle = undef;
    $handle = DBI->connect( ... )
  	  or throw perfSONAR_PS::Error_compat( "error.common.storage", "Could not connect to database: " . $DBI::errstr . "\n" );
  	return $handle;
  }

  ### script.pl ###
  
  # in the calling code
  my $dbh = undef;
  try {
  
    $dbh = &openDB();
  
  }
  catch perfSONAR_PS::Error_compat with {
  
    # print the contents of the error object (the string)
    print "An error occur: ".$@->eventType."/".$@->errorMessage."\n";
  
  }
  otherwise {
  
    # some other error occured!
    print "Some unknown error occurred! $@\n";
  
  }
  finally {
  
    print "Done!\n"'
  
  }; 
  
  # don't forget the trailing ';'
