=head1 NAME

perfSONAR_PS::Error

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A module that provides the exceptions framework for perfSONAR PS.  This module
provides the base object for all exception types that will be presented.

=cut

use base "Error";

use Error::Simple;

sub new {
    my $self = shift;
    my $text = "" . shift;
    my @args = ();

    local $Error::Depth = $Error::Depth + 1;
    local $Error::Debug = 1;

    $self->SUPER::new( -text => $text, @args );
    return;
}

=head2 toEventType

returns the perfsonar event type for this exception as a string, ensure that you
throw the appropriate inheritied exception object for automatic eventType
creation.

=cut

sub eventType {
    my $self = shift;
    my $ex   = ref $self;

    # form the '.' notation for the exceptions

    # ensure that camel cased words are separated
    my $s = undef;
    ( $s = ref $self ) =~ s/([a-z])([A-Z])/$1_$2/g;

    # remove perfSONAR_PS
    my @str = split /\:\:/, lc $s;
    shift @str;

    return join '.', @str;
}

=head2 errorMessage

returns the error message itself (also the same as casting the object as a
string)

=cut

sub errorMessage {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->text();
}

1;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # first define the errors somewhere
  package Some::Error;
  use base "Error::Simple";
  1;
  
  use Some::Error;

  # you MUST import this, otherwise the try/catch blocks will fail
  use Error qw(:try);  

  # if an error occurs, perfSONAR_PS objects should throw an error eg
  sub openDB {
    my $handle = undef;
    $handle = DBI->connect( ... )
  	  or throw Some::Error( "Could not connect to database: " . $DBI::errstr . "\n" );
  	return $handle;
  }


  ### script.pl ###
  
  # in the calling code
  my $dbh = undef;
  try {
  
    $dbh = &openDB();
  
  }
  catch Some::Error with {
  
    # print the contents of the error object (the string)
    print "An error occurred $@\n";
  
  }
  otherwise {
  
    # some other error occured!
    print "Some unknown error occurred! $@\n";
  
  }
  finally {
  
    print "Done!\n"'
  
  }; 
  
  # don't forget the trailing ';'
