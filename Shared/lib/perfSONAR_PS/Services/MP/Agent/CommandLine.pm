=head1 NAME

perfSONAR_PS::Services::MP::Agent::CommandLine 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A module that will run a command and return it's output.  Inherited
perfSONAR_PS::MP::Agent::Base class that allows a command to be executed.
Specific tools should inherit from this class and override parse() in order to
be able to format the command line output in a well understood data structure.

# derive from teh base agent class
use perfSONAR_PS::Services::MP::Agent::Base;
use base qw(perfSONAR_PS::Services::MP::Agent::Base);

use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);
our $logger = Log::Log4perl::get_logger( 'perfSONAR_PS::Services::MP::Agent::CommandLine' );

=head2 new( $command, $options, $namespace)

Creates a new agent class

  $command = complete path to command line tool to run, eg /bin/ping
  $options = special parsed string of arguments for the tool; this string will have variables replaced at run time
  $namespace = perfSONAR_PS::XML::Namespace object

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $package, $command, $options ) = @_;
    my %hash = ();
    if ( defined $command and $command ne "" ) {
        $hash{"CMD"} = $command;
    }
    if ( defined $options and $options ne "" ) {
        $hash{"OPTIONS"} = $options;
    }
    %{ $hash{"RESULTS"} } = ();

    bless \%hash => $package;
}

=head2 command( $string )

accessor/mutator function for the generic command to run (normally set in the
constructor). This command should have variable fields marked up between '%'s.
For example for a ping we would have something like:

  '/bin/ping -c %count% %destination%';
  
This would then have the values to these variables substituted in at runtime.

=cut

sub command {
    my $self = shift;
    if ( @_ ) {
        $self->{"CMD"} = shift;
    }
    return $self->{"CMD"};
}

=head2 commandString( $string )

accessor/mutator function for the actual command line to run; this would be 
the run time command after $self->command() has had the relevant variables 
substituted.

=cut

sub commandString {
    my $self = shift;
    if ( @_ ) {
        $self->{"CMD2RUN"} = shift;
    }
    return $self->{"CMD2RUN"};
}

=head2 options( \%hash )

accessor/mutator function for the variable=value set to substitute the 
$self->command() line with. ie for the ping example with command(), we would have:

  $self->command( '/bin/ping -c %count% %destination%' );
  $self->options( {
      'count' => 10,
      'destination' => 'localhost',
  	};

which would result in
  /bin/ping -c 10 localhost
  
=cut

sub options {
    my $self = shift;
    if ( @_ ) {
        $self->{"OPTIONS"} = shift;
    }
    return $self->{"OPTIONS"};
}

=head2 init( )

does anything necessary before running the collect() such as modifying the 
options etc.
Check to see that the command exists

=cut

sub init {
    my $self = shift;
   
    return 0;
}

=head2 collectMeasurements( )

Runs the command with the options specified in constructor. 
The return of this method should be

 -1 = something failed
  0 = command ran okay

on success, this method should call the parse() method to determine 
the relevant performance output from the tool.

=cut

sub collectMeasurements {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

    my $cmd = $self->command();

        # do i really want to do this here?

        $logger->error( $self->error( $err ) );

    }
    return 0;
}

=head2 parse( )

Given the output of the command as a ref to an array of strings (\@array), 
and the original command line that generated those strings ($commandLine) 
at time $time (epoch secs),

do something with that output and store in into $self->{RESULTS}.

Return:

  -1 = could not parse output
   0 = everything parsed okay
   
The data structure is completely arbitary, but should be understood by the 
inherited class.

    my $self        = shift;
    my $array       = shift;
