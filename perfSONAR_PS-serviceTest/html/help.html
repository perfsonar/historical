<p> <h3>Bandwidth Graph</h3>
The graph displays throughout test results for forward (src-dst) and reverse(dst-src) directions. 

<br/><br/><b>X-value and Y-value labels:</b>
When you mouse over the graph, exact value on the graph is highlighted and the corresponding X axis and Y axis values are displayed near the top-right corner of the graph.

<br/><br/><b> Zoom In: </b>
The graphs support two types of zoom: <br/>
<ol>
<li>Vertical Zoom(Y axis): Place your mouse-pointer inside the graph and drag the mouse over the range of Y values you want to zoom in.
<li> Horizontal zoom (X axis): Place your mouse-pointer inside the graph and drag the mouse over the range of X values you want to zoom in.
</ol>

<b>Zoom out: </b>
To zoom out, double-click inside the graph.

<br/></br/><b>Sharing Graph URL with others: </b>
You can get the URL of the current graph by clicking on the Show/Hide Link located near the Statistics table. Click on the link and copy/paste the URL that appears in the box.

<br/></br/><b>Visualizing other time ranges: </b>
There are two links provided near the graph that allows you to step through specific time periods(1 month). If you want to visualize arbitrary time periods, copy the URL and change the start_time and end_time accordingly.

<br/><br/>

<p> <h3>Delay Graph</h3>
The graph displays one way delay test results for a particular source and destination. The graphs has two Y axis. The left axis plots delay values and the right axis is for loss values.
The default view has minimum delay and loss turned on.

<br/><br/><b> Viewing reverse direction: </b>
