About

The perfSONAR-serviceTest is a web interface that allows users to query an MA and look at the
tests running in that MA. Users can also look at graphs for those test results.

Installation Instructions:


1) RPM

Download the perfSONAR-serviceTest RPM from 
http://anonsvn.internet2.edu/svn/perfSONAR-PS/branches/sowmya-cgiscripts/perfSONAR_PS-serviceTest-GUI-general/perl-perfSONAR_PS-serviceTest-3.1-1.pSPS.noarch.rpm

CONFIGURATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

If you are installing it on a toolkit, then you do not have to change the config file entries. The config file has been 
pre configured to work on toolkits

If you want to add hosts to the config file, you need to know the layout of the config file to make the necessary changes.

Config file Layout

The config file consists of 
	a) services
	b) serviceDisplayName
	c) hosts
	d) groups

a) services
The services category usually maps namespace to a short service name. You do not have to edit this

b) serviceDisplayName
This is the name that will be used to display on the web interface. For example, you can refer to owamp as One Way Delay or 
One Way Latency and provide this mapping here.

c) hosts
Here, you can map host names to their url. List all the hosts that you wish to display to the user

d) groups
If you have more than one host, then use this to group the hosts. You will need to have a minimum of 1 group if you have more than 1 host.


Example config file entries
services:
    owamp: "http://ggf.org/ns/nmwg/characteristic/delay/summary/20070921"

serviceDisplayName:
    owamp: "One Way Delay"

hosts:
    host1: "http://owamp-host1:8085/perfSONAR_PS/services/pSB"
    host2: "http://owamp-host2:8085/perfSONAR_PS/services/pSB"
    host3: "http://owamp-host3:8085/perfSONAR_PS/services/pSB"

groups:
    name: default
    id: 1
    type: "owamp"
    members: ["host1", "host2", "host3"]
