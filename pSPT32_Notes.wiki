<wiki:toc max_depth="6" />

== Goals ==

  * A different base Linux version to replace the current Knoppix base
  * Multiple installation possibilities
    * A Live CD version of the toolkit that functions similar to the current Knoppix-based version
    * A kickstart file to enable end users install their own version of the toolkit
    * A CD that users can boot and install the toolkit onto their hard drive
  * A method for upgrading existing systems to the new version
    * including saving existing configuration and data
    * At minimum, this upgrade will be for the Live CD toolkit version, but it would be nice to allow folks to upgrade their Live CD-based systems to installed systems.

== Base ==
=== Base Distribution ===
The pS-Performance Toolkit 3.2 release will be based on CentOS 5.5. There are a
number of reasons behind why CentOS 5.5 was selected as opposed to some other
version of Linux.

  * _*Widely Used*_: A large number of our end users are using CentOS or RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.x. They're comfortable with that versioning, and in some cases, the fact that we would be modifying CentOS makes security clearances and the like much easier.
  * _*Freely Available*_: Anyone is able to download, use and redistribute CentOS without needing to get specific licenses. The ability to redistribute is what allows us to make available the toolkit without having to go through a number of lawyers figuring out what's needed.
  * _*Stability*_: The CentOS 5.X series will be supported until 2014. Other distributions may or may not have long term support, and may not make package stability the highest priority (e.g. [http://lwn.net/Articles/377930/ Fedora])
  * _*Existing Packages*_: The perfSONAR-PS group has made all of their tools and services available as RPMs. The use of CentOS allows us to make use of the work that MCNC has done in packaging things like Web100 and NDT.
  * _*Various Installation Options*_: Once we have produced a kickstart installation routine for the toolkit, there are a number of utilities available that will allow us to use slightly modified versions of those kickstart files to produce things like bootable live CDs, installation CDs, etc. It also allows us to setup a repository allowing people to install the various utilities on their pre-existing CentOS or RedHat systems.

=== Tools/Services ===
The measurement tools/services that will come with the toolkit:

  * PingER
  * perfSONAR-BUOY
  * bwctl
  * owamp
  * NDT
  * NPAD
  * SNMP MA
  * Cacti
  * hLS
  * LS registration daemon
  * LS cache daemon

=== Web Interface ===
The web interface, for the initial version, will be a direct port of the web interface available on the current toolkit.

== Install CD/DVD Version ==
The Install CD/DVD version of the toolkit will provide end users an ISO that they can boot up that will install the Toolkit onto their system with a minimum of fuss. The version of the toolkit is not meant to be an upgrade for the existing 3.1 series.

== Live CD Version ==
The Live CD version of the toolkit is meant to be an upgrade to the 3.1 series of the toolkit, and will work in the same general fashion as the current toolkit: the user will boot the Live CD, and the configuration and data will be stored on the local hard drive.

== Roadmap ==

=== Milestone Base 1 ===
  * Produce packages all the tools/services, and any libraries or tools required for installation
  * Setup an repository to hold all these packages
  * NOTE: This does not include the web guis, and when the GUIs are packaged, the above packages may need to be changed
  * Allow interested parties to install the packages, and provide feedback

=== Milestone Base 2 - Alpha ===
  * Produce a kickstart file that will install all of the tools/services
  * Distribute the kickstart to a few interested parties as an alpha release, if desired

=== Milestone Base 3 - Beta ===
  * Produce a package of the web configuration GUI
  * Modify the kickstart to include the web configuration GUI
  * Distribute the kickstart to a few interested parties as an alpha release

=== Milestone Base 4 ===
  * Based on user feedback and testing, firm up the kickstart

=== Milestone Install CD/DVD 1 - Beta ===
  * Depends: Milestone Base 4
  * Using the Base kickstart, produce an initial installation CD that includes all the RPMs and the kickstart on a single ISO
  * Distribute this ISO to users for testing
  * Migrate changes to the Base packages/kickstart as needed

=== Milestone Install CD/DVD 2 ===
  * Based on user feedback and testing, firm up the installation CD.
  * Migrate changes to the Base packages/kickstart as needed

=== Milestone Live CD 1 - Alpha ===
  * Depends: Milestone Base 4
  * Using the Base kickstart, produce an initial Live CD version
  * Distribute this Live CD to users for testing
  * NOTE: it is not expected that this initial Live CD will allow for upgrading an existing installation
  * Migrate changes to the Base packages/kickstart as needed

=== Milestone Live CD 2 - Beta ===
  * Add functionality to the Live CD to allow it to upgrade an existing installation
  * Fix bugs and issues based on user feedback and testing
  * Distribute this Live CD to users for testing
  * Migrate changes to the Base packages/kickstart as needed

=== Milestone Live CD 3 ===
  * Based on user feedback and testing, firm up the Live CD.
  * Migrate changes to the Base packages/kickstart as needed

=== Milestone Release Candidate 1 ===
  * Depends: Milestone Live CD 3, Milestone Install CD/DVD 2
  * Produce installation documentation for each of the installation methods
  * Produce toolkit documentation for the various services and web guis
  * Synchronize the changes needed to the Base by the various installation methods
  * Produce a kickstart, an installation ISO and a Live CD ISO
  * Distribute to interested parties

=== Milestone Release Candidate X ===
  * Firm up documentation based on user feedback
  * Fix any issues based on user feedback and testing
  * Produce updated kickstart, installation ISO and Live CD ISO
  * Distribute to interested parties
  * Repeat as necessary to fix issues

=== Milestone Final Release ===
  * Finalize documentation
  * Produce any wider release announcements
  * Produce final versions of kickstart, installation ISO and Live CD ISO
