 # Actions from last call:
   * gLS testing status?
      * Andy & Eric met with Marcos & Ahmed and assigned tasks.
      * Marcos: his part of the tests are done & posted.  Need to analyze results still.
   * pSPT 3.1.2 deployment status (experiences)?
      * Most of Atlas has it deployed.
      * Some issues being reported & Andy & Eric are looking into it.
      * A segfault probably happening when perl is trying to exit.
      * Stuff is restarting just fine so it doesn't appear to be a critical problem.
      * Also a problem with psb & bwctl.
   * ATLAS SNMP issues - status?
      * Joe & Brian discussed it with Shawn.  We believe he now understands the complexity of the issues.
      * We would like to address this, but it is not a top priority right now.
 # LHCOPN status update - Joe
   * E2Emon was discussed at length.
   * The community wanted the perfSONAR tools to measure & report about the LHCOPN network pledges by the T1's (ie measure delivered bandwidth & availability)
 # DICE status update - "Product Manager" (Joe)
   * We worked through 3 of 4 use cases (portal, diagnostic, dynamic circuit monitoring).
 # OGF status update (Jason)
   * 1 NML session, working on a doc which should be ready next meeting
   * 2 NMC sessions  Jeff presented APAN slides.  limited number of tourists. Lots of DFN folks.
      * DFN is seeing problems with the RRDma & 700 interfaces.  Not sure if it is protocol or implementation issues.
      * Roman went over a result code proposal. Well on the way to being done.
      * Layed out what needs to be done on the base doc and tried to identify people who will do it.
 # pSPT 3.1.3 Release (Jason)
    * Andy and Aaron working hard on this.
    * Un-resolved issues
      * Logging core dumps on exit
      * Cache discussions
        * Each toolkit crawls the entire hls/gls space & caches data locally hourly. But it is missing services periodically & it doesn't scale.
        * Currently leaning towards developing an index service that would do the crawling, and then the toolkits would just hit the index service and download the details.
        * Andy & Aaron will be working this issue. Please provide any suggestions via the issue tracker.
      * Updating NDT  ( Rich has released a bunch of versions since the one we are using.)
      * On track to have testers available in 2 weeks, and out by members meeting
 # Team Updates
   * Internet2 Team Updates
   * ESnet
      * Review Brian's email about the new directory.cgi script David is working on.
  # *Future topics*:
   * _*pSPS*_:
     * Community handling in regular testing screens.  If the user doesn't pick a community, others can'y use this mechanism to find the node
       * N.B. the node is still _findable_ via other methods including domain/IP and it does show up in the gLS
       * Does it make sense to set a default?
       * Should there be other methods to find sans communities?
     * GUIs
       * BWCTL
       * OWAMP
   * _*Google MLab*_
     * Register each deployment (and tools on each) into pSPS
     * GUI to find an NDT server.  Started by *Jason*, still have the _public_ vs _private_ routing to these servers
     * Make MLab data public - even better expose it via pSPS
   * _*NSF perfSONAR Workshop*_
     * How would a researcher use pS to fulfill research goals?
     * How do you get tool developers to publish via pS?
     * NSF will be creating a steering committee for this workshop.
     * Hopefully NSF is interested in funding pS.
   * _*Service Monitoring*_
     * Availability (current + historic)
     * Nagios Plugins
     * Data monitoring vs service liveness
   * _*Config management*_
     * Sharing service configuration through IS
     * Centralized way to manage configs of similar services.  
   * _*Status Collection Enhancements*_
     * Overview: DCN _Status_ page uses the TL1 collector to extract and display many of the Cienna counters.  Currently only cares about interfaces and interface-like things.  
     * Similar Work: Jon Dugan's [http://code.google.com/p/esxsnmp/|ESxSNMP] which is a high performance SNMP polling system.  
     * Enhancement Ideas
       * Combine efforts to use TL1 collectors in ESxSNMP.  Would use same database backend and pS interface by doing this
       * Collecting/Storing network topology.  Specifically: how interfaces are connected via the switching fabric/external links and any other tie ins to the discussions in working groups. 
       * Gathering and storing alarm information.  Is this the same as Status?  Could or should this be done in nagios.
