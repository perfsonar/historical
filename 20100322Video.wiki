== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees: 
 # Actions from last call:
   * gLS testing status?
   * pSPT 3.1.2 deployment status (experiences)?
   * ATLAS SNMP issues - status?
 # DICE status update - "Product Manager" (Joe)
 # OGF status update (Jason)
 # pSPT 3.1.3 Release (Jason)
 # Team Updates
 # *Future topics*:
   * _*pSPS*_:
     * Community handling in regular testing screens.  If the user doesn't pick a community, others can'y use this mechanism to find the node
       * N.B. the node is still _findable_ via other methods including domain/IP and it does show up in the gLS
       * Does it make sense to set a default?
       * Should there be other methods to find sans communities?
     * GUIs
       * BWCTL
       * OWAMP
   * _*Google MLab*_
     * Register each deployment (and tools on each) into pSPS
     * GUI to find an NDT server.  Started by *Jason*, still have the _public_ vs _private_ routing to these servers
     * Make MLab data public - even better expose it via pSPS
   * _*NSF perfSONAR Workshop*_
     * How would a researcher use pS to fulfill research goals?
     * How do you get tool developers to publish via pS?
     * NSF will be creating a steering committee for this workshop.
     * Hopefully NSF is interested in funding pS.
   * _*Service Monitoring*_
     * Availability (current + historic)
     * Nagios Plugins
     * Data monitoring vs service liveness
   * _*Config management*_
     * Sharing service configuration through IS
     * Centralized way to manage configs of similar services.  
   * _*Status Collection Enhancements*_
     * Overview: DCN _Status_ page uses the TL1 collector to extract and display many of the Cienna counters.  Currently only cares about interfaces and interface-like things.  
     * Similar Work: Jon Dugan's [http://code.google.com/p/esxsnmp/|ESxSNMP] which is a high performance SNMP polling system.  
     * Enhancement Ideas
       * Combine efforts to use TL1 collectors in ESxSNMP.  Would use same database backend and pS interface by doing this
       * Collecting/Storing network topology.  Specifically: how interfaces are connected via the switching fabric/external links and any other tie ins to the discussions in working groups. 
       * Gathering and storing alarm information.  Is this the same as Status?  Could or should this be done in nagios.  
 
=== ACTIONS ===

  * _*ACTION*_: Marcos will communicate with Andy/Brian on the work he is doing with the gLS.  All parties shoudl work together on testing.
  * _*ACTION*_: Next meeting will be a topic meeting on gLS performance testing.
