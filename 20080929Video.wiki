== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees: Joe, Matt, Jason, Aaron, Jeff, Jared, Antonio
 # Team Updates
   # Internet2
     * Aaron - lots of bug fixes for ISO release. (Services now restarted from web config)
     * Jason - Arranging beta test deployments (12 remote sites tried it). Keeping track of bug reports and entering 'issues'. Fixed several outstanding bugs.
     * Jeff - Pam paper, ISO testing, Branding/Naming issues.
   # IU
   # UDEL
   # Ga Tech
   # ESnet
     * Joe - Deploying on ESnet backbone (Using CFEngine and SVN). Working on Domain Utiliztion Browser. Made a PAM paper edit pass - concerned with lack of federated measurement infrastructures.
   # SLAC
     * Jared - ISO testing, also introduced Antonio who will be working on perfSONAR in the future.
   # FNAL
   # MCNC
 # ISO - Naming
   [http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/perfnodelabel.png CD Cover Image]
     * There was concern that the new name did not convey the perfSONAR connection. Jeff will work on this with Internet2 marketing types.
 # ISO - Status (Outstanding bugs, etc)
     * Seem to have a good handle on outstanding bugs.
     * Concern about making good recommendations for user communities. i.e. Want all LHC participants to use the same 'keyword'. General concensus seemed to be that we want user communities to drive this themself, but that we should provide a boiler-plate for this - and perhaps some wiki space for it. Jeff will look into making something like this available on the Internet2 'spaces' wiki.
 # Pam paper
   # Editing status
     * Several passes have happened. Brian could not be on, so this will continue to be coordinated via email.
   # Data status
     * Jason reported that there is data from UMich and FNAL. The 'units' issue for the UMich data has been sorted out, and data seems to be stabalizing. It looks like we will hopefully be able to get a good 24 hour period of data.
 # GLIF Demo Update (Aaron/Jeff)
     * Aaron reports that the demo circuit and monitoring is mostly stable. Jeff will be presenting a perfSONAR architecture overview and helping Thomas Tam demo the E2EMon GUI.
 # Central configuration service
   * Need to talk about how to harmonize service configuration files in functionality and syntax. And how that effects centralized configuration.(Likely won't have time to discuss this, but I'm keeping it on the agenda as very high priority for the *next* version).
 # Next meeting will Oct 6, 2:30 pm Eastern Time
