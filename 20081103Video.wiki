== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees:Rich, Aaron, Joe, Brian, Maxim, Jeff, John
 # Team Updates
   # Internet2
        * Aaron: MA for tl1 alarms working to monitor SCinet WAN gear. BWC entry with perfSONAR monitoring integrated. (CPU utilization, Network device values, Memory usage - lots of things that can be retrieved from /proc).
        * Rich: LHC USATLAS about half-way deployed. Sites need better documentation on how to configure.
        * Jeff: 
        * Jason: 
   # IU
        * John: Has 10g in LA. Working on nagios for SCinet monitoring. For Transpac: LOSA and Tokyo perfSONAR deployments are active.
   # UDEL
   # Ga Tech
   # ESnet
        * Brian: Installed pingER MA on 10 owamp boxes. Refuse to register with hLSs.(Reported in Issue tracker, Jason is testing some fixes he believes will address the problem.) LOI - for perfSONAR proposal to SCiDAC.
        * Joe: Working on owamp,bwctl deployments. Can have some available for SC.
   # SLAC
   # FNAL
        * Maxim: Vacation... Focused on supporting hostname/type parameters for pingER queries and handling errors. Discussion of landmarks files configuration options. (size of pings, etc...) Interest in more functionality from the weathermap (additional metrics etc).
   # MCNC
 # SC status
   * New Weathermap proposal
     * Still very basic: http://dc211.internet2.edu/SC08/
     * Will hide/show DCN circuits via OSCARS MA
     * Will use utilization from SNMP MA
       * Interest in other metrics?
 # Central configuration service
   * Need to talk about how to harmonize service configuration files in functionality and syntax. And how that effects centralized configuration.
     * *_JZ:_* We keep putting this off, but I would like to put it off a little more since this is a non-trivial problem, and the development/thinking cycles will be pretty sparse until after November.
 # Deployment Status Listings
   * How do we decide what goes in the list? Everything? Do we attempt to validate?
     * Joe will send out comments from Jason Lee to start this discussion.
 # ISO - Functional Specification
   * Attempt to make sure functionality is clear from a user perspective, and to ensure that the disc is useful from a diagnostic perspective as well as a measurement-point perspective.
 # Discussion of middle-term goals
   * Release management
   * It has been proposed that after SC, we shore up a very few pieces of missing functionality, and then concentrate on hardening and optimizing the software we have.
   * If that is the general sentiment, perhaps we can come up with the specific short list of functionality we want to deal with - and come up with ideas on what reasonable processes we can go through to harden/optimize.
 # Next meeting will be Dec 1, 2:30 pm Eastern Time
