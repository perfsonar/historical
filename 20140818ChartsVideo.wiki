 * Attendees: Brian, Andy, Jason, Michael

= Introduction =

Meeting for discussing the state of charts for RC3 and beyond.

= Notes =


Items that need to be done for RC3:
 * Add ping to charts
 * Style issues
 * Use base data for < 1 day timeframes (maybe 3-days if reasonable)
 * Pagination on table to help with scaling problem with many tests


Items that need to be done for real release:
 * Add median option for latency
 * Traceroute page link on chart
  * Easy to add a link
 * But what if there is no data?
 * query ma to see what data is available? ("packet_trace" event type) 
 * What if you have multiple parameters? traceroute page only supports 2
 * Display links in graph header 



Items that can wait until 3.4.1:


== Style issues ==
 * Remove -PS from table page header
 * Make links to charts more obvious/add "Click on a hostname to see a graph of the results" 
 * Fix weird whitespace with multiple hosts at top of individual chart page
 * Red/green may be bad for color-blind people (will someone follow-up on this)?




== Items that can wait until 3.4.1:
 * Zooming is difficult, sometimes get stuck
 * Reset zoom button and/or double-click to reset it?
