==== pS Agenda ====

  # Release Management
    * Review of the process; comments from developers
    * Code Review (see also [pSPS20090327Release#Code_Review_Reviews these] comments)
      * _*accessPoint*_ in configuration: should not rely on _localhost_
        * Construct access point on the fly (NPToolkit like - prone to errors)
        * Exit if no access point found (e.g. if still _localhost_ or _CHANGEME_)
      * Standardize configuration files
        * Services use different types (Config::Genera, OWP, homemade)
        * File formats differ when we do this    
      * Standardize LSRegistration
        * provide _*getMetadata*_ function in a base class, let the daemon do the rest
        * will be tricky for dynamic vs static services (where the metadata may or may not change)
        * should re-consider LS architecture regarding this too
      * Use of _*Class::Accessor*_/_*Class::Fields*_
        * Everyone should use them, or no one should
        * Mixture of sometimes vs never makes the framework messy
  # Configuration Management
    * Problem statement (e.g. management of several services domain wide - possibly deployed via RPMs)
    * Current range of existing solutions
    * Proposals
  # Meta-scheduler for cross measurement point use
    * schedule bwctl/ping/owamp/ndt tests so they don't interfere
  # Upcoming Demos/Releases/Conferences
    * See the [pSPSReleaseManagement#Roadmap roadmap]
    * Summer Joint Techs
    * Fall Member Meeting
    * GLIF
    * SC

=== pS/IDC Developers (5/1)===

This meeting will focus primarily on the topics that related to circuit monitoring. This will touch on global identifiers, topology, technology/layer abstraction and monitoring architecture. We will have phone conferences in the weeks leading up to this to articulate use cases and general architecture. The plan is for the meeting to be used to fully describe that architecture to everyone involved, and break it down into action items for development.

If IDC developers like, a portion of the day can be set aside for other current topics.

== Local Information ==

Some compiled local information from a _semi-local_.  Will add more over time, requests for specific information would be great.  

=== DC Office ===

Located in the _Golden Triangle_ neighborhood, borders Dupont/Scott Circle and George Washington University.  Not known for great food or restaurants (walk somewhere north or east for the good stuff).  Office Address:

{{{
1150 18th Street, NW
Suite 1020
Washington, DC 20036
}}}

This is between _*L*_ and _*M*_ streets on _*18th*_ (left side of street when facing North, white building between 2 parking garages).  The office is on the 10th floor (see the lobby attendant when entering).  

From Orange/Blue Metro Line:

Get off at the *Farragut West* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=38 stop].  There are two exits, please exit on _18th Street_.  Walk *North* along 18th street (*Straight* as you exit the station) and cross over _K_ and _L_ Streets.  1150 is midway between _L_ and _M_ on the left hand side, it is a white building.

From Red Metro Line:

Get off at the *Farragut North* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=4 stop].  There are three exits, please exit on one of the _L Street and Conn. Ave_ exits.  Walk *West* along L street (towards oncoming traffic) and cross over _18th_ Streets.  Make a right (*North*) onto _18th Street_, 1150 is midway between _L_ and _M_ on the left hand side, it is a white building.

=== Remote Participation ===

Video access is available, but limited to a small number of participants (4 or 5).  The video information is tenatively:

{{{
IP Address:     192.52.179.246 
GDS:            0011892028729111
}}}

Please arrange with Jason to test your connection before the meeting.  

=== Transportation (Airports) ===

[http://www.mwaa.com/national/ Reagan National Airport]

DCA is located along the Potomac river in Arlington VA.  Due to flight restrictions there are limited cross country flights each day, so finding a variety of arrival departure times is sometimes challenging.  DCA is directly connected to the Washington DC metro system via the *Yellow* and *Blue* lines making it easy to get to Crystal City (for the SMM) and into the city (where the Internet2 Office is located).  Allow 20 minutes to travel on the Metro between the DC office and the airport.  Security lines may be long during peak periods (Afternoons) - allow at least 45 minutes for security.

[http://www.mwaa.com/dulles Dulles International Airport]

IAD is located in Chantilly VA, which is fairly far out (and very close to were Jason lives).  There is a wider variety of airlines and schedules available here.  Unfortunately there is limited access to transportation.  The Metro does not extend to IAD (yet) so using the public bus ([http://www.wmata.com/bus/timetables/view.cfm?line=49 Route 5A], drops off at *Rosslyn* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=41 station] on the *Orange* and *Blue* lines) or a private coach service ([http://www.washfly.com/flyer_bus_about.htm Washington Flyer] picks up/drops off at the *West Falls Church* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=101 station] on the *Orange Line*) would be necessary.  It may take upwards of an hour to get from the airport to the DC office.  Security lines may be very long in the mornings and evenings - allow 45 minutes to an hour for security and 10 minutes for transportation to gates (shuttle buses).  

=== Transportation (Ground) ===

Using the [http://www.wmata.com/rail/maps/map.cfm Metro] is by far the easiest way to get around.  I would suggest buying a _SmartTrip_ electronic card (comes with $10 loaded on it) and using this for your stay.  The card can be loaded with more value as you need it in any station.  This is preferred to attempting to purchase paper tickets for each ride, or trying to figure out the strange rules regarding entry vs exit fare, etc.

Shuttle services such as [http://www.washfly.com/flyer_bus_about.htm Washington Flyer] and [http://www.supershuttle.com/ Super Shuttle] can get you to the airports.

Taxis are also common, note some are _un-licensed_ and no longer follow the _zone_ fare rules.

=== Suggested Hotel ===

We recommend staying at the [http://cwp.marriott.com/wasgw/internettwo09/ Crystal Gateway Marriott] when attending these meetings. (Everyone attending the SMM will already be there, so this is where most people will already be staying.) This hotel offers a competitive rate compared to hotels in the DC business district.  The information page is [http://cwp.marriott.com/wasgw/internettwo09/ here].  The hotel address is:

{{{
Crystal Gateway Marriott
1700 Jefferson Davis Highway
Arlington, Virginia 22202 
}}}

From the hotel we will take the [20090429Meet#DC_Office Blue Line] in the morning to get to the office.  Note it may take about a half hour and trains will be crowded in the morning.  

=== Alternative Hotels ===

There are several other hotels available within walking distance of the DC office, prices will vary (check a travel site for best deals - note that the listed prices were captured in late February and will adjust with the local market).  April is the start of tourist season, so prices may begin to be expensive.  Most hotels offer government rates.
