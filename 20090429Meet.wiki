== Local Information ==

Some compiled local information from a _semi-local_.  Will add more over time, requests for specific information would be great.  

=== DC Office ===

Located in the _Golden Triangle_ neighborhood, borders Dupont/Scott Circle and George Washington.  Not known for great food or restaurants (walk somewhere north or east for the good stuff).  Office Address:

{{{
1150 18th Street, NW
Suite 1020
Washington, DC 20036
}}}

This is between _*L*_ and _*M*_ streets on _*18th*_ (left side of street when facing North).  The office is on the 10th floor (see the lobby attendant when entering).  

From Orange/Blue Metro Line:

Get off at the *Farragut West* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=38 stop].  There are two exits, please exit on _18th Street_.  Walk *North* along 18th street (*Straight* as you exit the station) and cross over _K_ and _L_ Streets.  1150 is midway between _L_ and _M_ on the left hand side, it is a white building.

From Red Metro Line:

Get off at the *Farragut North* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=4 stop].  There are three exits, please exit on one of the _L Street and Conn. Ave_ exits.  Walk *West* along L street (towards oncoming traffic) and cross over _18th_ Streets.  Make a right (*North*) onto _18th Street_, 1150 is midway between _L_ and _M_ on the left hand side, it is a white building.

=== Transportation (Airports) ===

[http://www.mwaa.com/national/ Reagan National Airport]

DCA is located along the Potomac river in Arlington VA.  Due to flight restrictions there are limited cross country flights each day, so finding a variety of arrival departure times is sometimes challenging.  DCA is directly connected to the Washington DC metro system via the *Yellow* and *Blue* lines making it easy to get to Crystal City (for the SMM) and into the city (where the Internet2 Office is located).

IAD is located in Chantilly VA, which is fairly far out (and very close to were Jason lives).  There is a wider variety of airlines and schedules available here.  Unfortunately there is limited access to transportation.  The Metro does not extend to IAD (yet) so using the public bus ([http://www.wmata.com/bus/timetables/view.cfm?line=49 Route 5A], drops off at *Rosslyn* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=41 station] on the *Orange* and *Blue* lines) or a private coach service ([http://www.washfly.com/flyer_bus_about.htm Washington Flyer] picks up/drops off at the *West Falls Church* [http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=101 station] on the *Orange Line*) would be necessary.

=== Transportation (Ground) ===

Using the [http://www.wmata.com/rail/maps/map.cfm Metro] is by far the easiest way to get around.  I would suggest buying a _SmartTrip_ electronic card (comes with $10 loaded on it) and using this for your stay.  The card can be loaded with more value as you need it in any station.  This is preferred to attempting to purchase paper tickets for each ride, or trying to figure out the strange rules regarding entry vs exit fare, etc.

Shuttle services such as [http://www.washfly.com/flyer_bus_about.htm Washington Flyer] and [http://www.supershuttle.com/ Super Shuttle] can get you to the airports.

Taxis are also common, note some are _un-licensed_ and no longer follow the _zone_ fare rules.

=== Hotels ===

Since some folks will attend the Spring Member Meeting (and this hotel has a much cheaper rate than hotels in the downtown district), we are recommending that people book there and take the Metro to the DC office.  The information page is [http://cwp.marriott.com/wasgw/internettwo09/ here].  The hotel address is:

{{{
Crystal Gateway Marriott
1700 Jefferson Davis Highway
Arlington, Virginia 22202 
}}}

There are several other hotels available within walking distance of the DC office, prices will vary (check a travel site for best deals).  Note that April is the start of tourist season, so prices may be expensive.  Most hotels offer government rates.
