 # Attendees: Luke, Aaron, Jason, Jeff, Yee, Martin
 # Team Updates
   # Ga Tech
   # ESnet
   # Internet2
     * Jeff is working on the perf-o-meter for Jt Techs. 
     * Jason has been working on a pS-UI compatible SNMP MA (and has it complete). 
     * Aaron has been working on topology and status MA services.
   # SLAC
     * Yee has been working with Maxim to define new Schema for pinger. 
     * This will be helpful for exposing pinger data through the pingerMA interface.
   # IU
     * Chris was not on, so a topology update will need to wait. 
     * Luke has made a host available for collecting RRD data of both the Internet2 network and the Indiana Giga-pop, this will be useful for the Jt Techs demo. 
     * He has noticed a CPU load issue with the SNMP MA - Jason will take a look and try and figure out what happened.
   # FNAL
   # UDEL
     * Martin has been working on a revision to the Topology schema to reflect control-plane issues. 
     * Ben has been attempting to get the traceroute MA/MP on planet-lab.
 # pS-PS
   * Anything new in the infrastructure portions?
     * No.
   * SNMP MA (Jason)
     * We need to discuss the changes needed to make this work with pS-UI. How do we resolve these differences?
       * pS-UI expects a specific format from an MA, specifically what the current RRDMA gives.  This format does not obey the 'chaining rules' as I would expect them to behave:
       * MA Input {{{ 
<nmwg:metadata id="1">
  <netutil:subject>
    <!-- partial/complete measurement data -->
  </netutil:subject>
  <nmwg:eventType>http://some.event/type/2.0</nmwg:eventType>
  <nmwg:parameters>
    <nmwg:parameter />
  </nmwg:parameters>
</nmwg:metadata>

<nmwg:metadata id="2">
  <select:subject metadataIdRef="1"/>
  <nmwg:eventType>http://some.event/type/select/2.0</nmwg:eventType>
  <select:parameters>
    <nmwg:parameter />
  </select:parameters>
</nmwg:metadata>

<nmwg:data id="d1" metadataIdRef="2" /> 
}}}
       * SNMP MA Output: {{{ 
<nmwg:metadata id="1">
  <netutil:subject>
    <!-- partial/complete measurement data -->
  </netutil:subject>
  <nmwg:eventType>http://some.event/type/2.0</nmwg:eventType>
  <nmwg:parameters>
    <nmwg:parameter />
  </nmwg:parameters>
</nmwg:metadata>

<nmwg:metadata id="2">
  <select:subject metadataIdRef="1"/>
  <nmwg:eventType>http://some.event/type/select/2.0</nmwg:eventType>
  <select:parameters>
    <nmwg:parameter />
  </select:parameters>
</nmwg:metadata>

<nmwg:data id="d1" metadataIdRef="2">
  <!-- datum elements -->
</nmwg:data> 
}}}
       * RRD MA Output: {{{ 
<nmwg:metadata id="store1">
  <netutil:subject>
    <!-- complete measurement data from store -->
  </netutil:subject>
</nmwg:metadata>

<nmwg:data id="d1" metadataIdRef="store1">
  <!-- datum elements -->
</nmwg:data> 
}}}
       * This is definitely a problem. Jason will see if the Java version is working as expected based on the interface definition documents that they wrote. We will figure out how to proceed based on the findings. (Could just be a bug-report, or it could be a more difficult discussion about what the interface should look like in the future.
   * Topology Service (Aaron)
     * Aaron has a topology service working that currently has an SQL and an XMLDB backend. As he looks at queries, if we support xquery syntax, we will need to either translate the xquery syntax into SQL queries, or drop the SQL backend. Currently it expects nodes, interfaces, links to all be top-level elements, but after discussions with Martin is seems likely we will change this to be more similar to what control-plane proponents want. (Nodes contain interfaces contain links).
   * Status-Monitoring Service (Aaron)
     * Aaron has a service working that can use constants, SNMP, scripts to fetch current status. The idea is that this will be accessed by something else that will correlate this information with the topology service information and use that to respond to the E2EMon queries.
   * LS Service (Jason)
     * Differences between Java
       * First difference is the 'store' element. The Java version expects a 'store' element container. We either need to fake one, or create one. Jason will look into the performance implications of each. Jason will continue to look for other differences, but expects he can work out most issues with Maciej directly.
   * PingerMA
     * No update
   * OWAMP/BWCTL MA (Warren)
     * No update
   * RRD Service (Internet2 network deployment)
     * Tabled until the compatibility issues can be resolved.
   * Jt Tech's demo
     * Trying to show link-utilization across multiple networks. (Universities, Internet2, ESnet, DOE-lab) Who can provide MA's with data for us? Basic demo will include pS-UI as well as a web-page showing some pre-configured paths with multiple perf-o-meters used to show the full path.
     * Jeff will ping Joe to see where ESnet is with this, and to find out what specific paths will be used to Jt Techs. We may be able to get data from Starlight as well as Firmi. Jason will follow up with Maxim and Warren. Yee will attempt to get an SNMP MA up as well.
 # Next call will be July 23.
