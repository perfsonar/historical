perfSONAR-BUOY is not configured to run by default: it requires knowledge of current and reachable BWCTL and OWAMP servers.  The above steps should be followd in order and will result in a configured service.

== Step 1 ==

After your machine is booted, visit the configuration web page (this can be done locally if you have console access to the freshly booted machine, or remotely): https://HOST_OR_ADDRESS/admin/perfsonarbuoy/.  This should bring up a screen similar to this:

== Step 2 ==

For now, only two choices work: *_BWCTL IPv4_* or *_BWCTL IPv6_* on the left side. Click on one of these (will illustrate with IPv4).

== Step 3 ==

A screen similar to this will appear (note on this test machine the mesh is already set up so values will appear selected already):

== Step 4 ==

Under _Select IPv4 BWCTL Instances to Include in Measurements_, choose BWCTL instances to test with. These are separated into groups that are associated with the LHC project, as well as other registered BWCTL test points. _Enter test Description_ is optional, but helpful to enter. Finally select a test type (note currently we only support one test at a time). 

There are three common options for tests: 

 * Test every *15* minutes for *10* seconds 
 * Test every *1* hour  for *60* seconds 
 * Test every *4* hours for *60* seconds 

More test options will be available in future releases.

== Step 5 ==

 The screen will look like this after selection: 

http://perfsonar-ps.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/NPToolkit/pSB2.png

Press _Save_ and wait for the browser to display a message indicating success. The browser can be closed and a terminal will be required to start the services: 

 * _/etc/init.d/pSB_master.sh restart_
 * _/etc/init.d/pSB_collector.sh restart_
 * _/etc/init.d/pSB.sh restart_

Due to the frequency of tests you have chosen, there may be a small lag when the results become available. 

== Step 6 ==

Finally from either the NPToolkit or some other machine, visit a perfSONAR testing instance described in [NPToolkitQuickStart#Service_Test Disk Verification - Service Test].
