 # Prioritize brain-storm goals from last meeting. (Time frame is next 6-12 mo)
     * Community defined measurement meshes.
     * Community defined dashboards/analysis.
     * ML or Spectrum gateways or RealTime alarms.
       * Persistent queries
     * Test framework
       * scalability
       * reliability
     * traceroute MA/MP
       * BGP MA?
     * How do multiple meshes interact? (BCP?)
     * Focus on deployments/production
       * GUIs
       * How do you use these tools to actually debug problems?
     * GUIs - easy to use, not demoware!
     * Installation usability
     * Need more user requirements?
       * Need to bring users the first good data GUIs, then we can iterate with users.
       * What specific visualizations do the users need? (First data must be there...)
 # SC
     * How much of the one-off coding can be turned into 'real' stuff?
 # Questions regarding gLS data displays - Brian
   # Should we advertise things that are only available to certain groups (e.g. NDT servers on Interent2 backbone are not reachable to home users - do we note this?  How?)
     * How do we manage expectations?
     * We will need ways to discern what data is available to write good GUIs, this issue is not just about the 'publicity' pages.
     * (Jeff suggestion: attack this problem by creating a GUI for actually addressing a specific performance problem - that GUI will need to figure this out...)
 # PAM/CHEP paper status
   # Where to resubmit PAM paper and when - Brian/Martin
   # Important Dates for CHEP - Maxim
 # Next meeting will be Jan 19, 2:30 pm Eastern Time
