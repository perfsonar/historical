Deployment instructions:
send any questions to Maxim Grigoriev, maxim_at_fnal_dot_gov
------------------------

Place all files in the directory which you plan to serve by webserver.
Open etc/GeneralSystem.conf and change:

server_name =  http://localhost

to the actual local hostname.  Also, you can change:

###  server port
server_port =  9090
#  where send mail
mailto = mailto:root
# dir for temporary files, should be writeable by webserver's daemon UID
scratch_dir =  /tmp

The rest of parameters should be left as is unless you really know what you are doing.
--------------------------------

Instructions for Apache config:
-------------------------------


If this file is located at /home/netadmin/LHCOPN/perfSONAR-PS/trunk/modules/perfSONAR_PS-Services-PingER-v0.01/pingerGUI/
then you or sysadmin of the host should add next lines in the Apache httpd.conf.
-------------------------------------------

ScriptAlias /gui-bin/ "/home/netadmin/LHCOPN/perfSONAR-PS/trunk/modules/perfSONAR_PS-Services-PingER-v0.01/pingerGUI/cgi-bin/"
Alias /stuff/   "/home/netadmin/LHCOPN/perfSONAR-PS/trunk/modules/perfSONAR_PS-Services-PingER-v0.01/pingerGUI/html/stuff/"
Alias /graphsMA/   "/tmp/graphsMA"
<Directory /gui-bin/>  
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
##  allow only http requests from your.domain 
    Allow from .your.domain
</Directory>
<Directory /graphsMA/>
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
##  allow only http requests from your.domain 
    Allow from .your.domain    
</Directory>
<Directory  /stuff/>
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
##  allow only http requests from your.domain 
    Allow from .your.domain    
</Directory>

--------------------------------------

Please not that /gui-bin/ is hardcoded in the API but you are free to rename actual directory location from cgi-bin to anything else.
The same try for /stuff/ directory. The graphsMA location is configurable in the  etc/GeneralSystem.conf, so if you cahnge it there then
it must be changed in Apache config as well.
