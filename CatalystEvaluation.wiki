#Evaluation and useful inforamtion about applicability of the perl's Catalyst web framework for ps-ps

The proposed solution for the ps-ps web interfaces is to utilize Catalyst with Template::Toolkit. There is no dependency on the webserver, it could be either plain Apache or anything with CGI support or FastCGI or mod_perl under Apache.
Thre are a lot of info on Catalyst on the web since its mature product with

= PingER UI use case =

The pinger data charts UI was moved under the Catalyst and TT from being CGI script with
CGI::Ajax and HTML::Template modules in use. It resulted in less code with more cleaner module structure although the MVC pattern was not utilized completely and all interactions with the Model ( remote MA ) were done under the Controller. Also, there was
only single View - TT based implemented and it didnt require any extra code except for the templates. The prototype.js was utilized as Ajax API and it required less coding as well because all Ajax callbacks were already implemented. 
From the scratch it took me only several minutes to build the whole directory tree with all basic tests and Catalyst came with own standalone server which was extremely helpful for the debugging. The Catalyst supports Log4perl logging 
The Catalyst is encouraging a "chain" pattern where you have several small calls each implementing only partial functinality. The internal "stash" storage makes its very easy to have session persistent storage among different components. Teh Catalyst framework makes its very easy to add numerous plugins for the higher level of persistence supported by Catalyst::Plugin::Session set of modules. Also, it supports role based authorization and multiple ways of authentication ( even OpenID whicj could be used as an example to write our own authentication plugin based on perfSONAR AA ).


= Misc =

The latest supoprted RPM package on DAG is perl-Catalyst-Runtime-5.7012 which is not the most up to date  ( 5.8 ) but more than enough for us. The 5.8 has support and built upon the new modern perl objects called  Moose but I dont think we will be turning our heads on this one soon. The Moose is still a slow alternative to hash based objects and requires much steeper learning curve and another half of CPAN modules.
