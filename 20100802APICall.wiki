 # Agenda bashing
 # Review updated use-case document
 # Two questions from Jeff Boote:
 (1) I'm curious how the list of available datatypes will be kept up to date?
 And how the API  will be extended to new data types. 
 For specifically the use cases Jason mentions from the pS Workshop, that will be key. 
 There are several researchers who will want to expose 'new' metrics.

 (2)I'm not sure the topology related data types are expressive enough... 
 For example, I'm 
 not sure I see how to reference a 'node' unless it is a L3 node. In fact, not sure I see 
 'node' at all - that really isn't the same thing as an interface - right?
