== Introduction ==

This page describes a test plan for current and future perfSONAR-PS releases.

There are 3 types of testing that needs to take place for each service:
 * basic functionality: are expected results returned for each query type
 * baseline performance: time for small/simple query and a typical query
 * scalability: make sure that performance degragation is reasonable as number queries/sec and query result size increase

== Current Status ==

Functionality: The current test_harness supports this, but many test queries are likely missing

Baseline performance: The current test_harness supports this

Scalability: no current mechanism for this

== Open Issues ==

We need a process to always run the test harness before releases, and make sure
the performance results are reasonable.

We need to figure out a good way to send many requests in parallel from many hosts. (possibly use planetlab for this?)


Questions:
 * do services handle ridiculously large requests well? (error message? break replies into batches? report cause of timeout?)


Special case: hLS/gLS testing
 * how to test scalability of gLS? update rate? number of hLS and gLSes? metadata size?
