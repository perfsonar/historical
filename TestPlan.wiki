#summary Test Plan for perfSONAR releases

= Introduction =

This page describes a test plan for current and future perfSONAR releases.

= Details =

The following should be tested for each service:
 * basic functionality: are expected results returned for each query type
 * baseline performance: time for small/simple query and a typical query
 * scalability: in terms of both number queries/sec and query result size

How to do these tests:
 * functionality and baseline performance: add sample queries to test framework and run 
 * scalability: ??


Needed:
 * good way to send many requests in parallel from many hosts (planetlab?)


Questions:
 * do services handle ridiculously large requests well? (error?)


Special case: hLS/gLS testing
 * how to test scalability of gLS? update rate? number of hLS and gLSes? metadata size?
