== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees: Eric, Andy, Jason, Fahad, Joe, Ezra, Brian, Marcos, Jeff, Maxim
 # Developer Updates
    * Eric: Working on deployment of gLS/hLS nodes in test deployment. Nearly ready for testing.
    * Andy: Helping with Atlas support issues. Also looking at owamp database issues. Have a proposal for how to do owamp data.
    * Jason: Involved with SC, BWC, publications. Working with Atlas. Would like testing this week. Seeing pingER issues.
    * Fahad: Nothing to report
    * Joe: Nothing to report
    * Ezra: Preparing for SC and BWC.
    * Brian: Testing the latest ISO.
    * Marcos: Working on IS testbed. Finding performance issues due to planet-lab limitations. Attempting to set database parameters to keep planet-lab from killing jobs.
    * Maxim: Working on pingER issue. Suspects the issue is that the landmarks file is being zero'd out somehow. Aaron mentioned that it is actually the MP that is not running.
    * Jeff: Totally on SCinet.
 # Actions from last call:
 * _*ACTION*_: Joe will add something to wiki about cfengine. 
 * _*ACTION*_: Andy will send a mail to the mailing list outlining what he was tasked with developing.  Aaron/Jason will add to this to see if there is overlap.
 * _*ACTION*_: Aaron to organize a separate meeting with people interested in this 
 # mailing lists
   * psps-dev, psps-announce, psps-users?
 # pS-PTK RC testing update.
   * How close are we to a 'production' bug-fix release?
     * Plan is to attempt to get a production ISO out tomorrow for internal testing only. As long as that works in testing, it will be made available to Atlas Friday.
 # SC
   * Coordination work
     * Joe/Aaron working on owamp/bwctl test coordination.
     * If interesting utilization wanted across backbones, aaron/jeff will ask eli for help finding in esnet.
 # Future topics:
   * _*pSPS*_:
     * Community handling in regular testing screens.  If the user doesn't pick a community, others can'y use this mechanism to find the node
       * N.B. the node is still _findable_ via other methods including domain/IP and it does show up in the gLS
       * Does it make sense to set a default?
       * Should there be other methods to find sans communities?
     * GUIs
       * BWCTL
       * OWAMP
   * _*Google MLab*_
     * Register each deployment (and tools on each) into pSPS
     * GUI to find an NDT server.  Started by *Jason*, still have the _public_ vs _private_ routing to these servers
     * Make MLab data public - even better expose it via pSPS
   * _*NSF perfSONAR Workshop*_
     * How would a researcher use pS to fulfill research goals?
     * How do you get tool developers to publish via pS?
     * NSF will be creating a steering committee for this workshop.
     * Hopefully NSF is interested in funding pS.
   * _*Service Monitoring*_
     * Availability (current + historic)
     * Nagios Plugins
     * Data monitoring vs service liveness
   * _*Config management*_
     * Sharing service configuration through IS
     * Centralized way to manage configs of similar services.  
   * _*Status Collection Enhancements*_
     * Overview: DCN _Status_ page uses the TL1 collector to extract and display many of the Cienna counters.  Currently only cares about interfaces and interface-like things.  
     * Similar Work: Jon Dugan's [http://code.google.com/p/esxsnmp/|ESxSNMP] which is a high performance SNMP polling system.  
     * Enhancement Ideas
       * Combine efforts to use TL1 collectors in ESxSNMP.  Would use same database backend and pS interface by doing this
       * Collecting/Storing network topology.  Specifically: how interfaces are connected via the switching fabric/external links and any other tie ins to the discussions in working groups. 
       * Gathering and storing alarm information.  Is this the same as Status?  Could or should this be done in nagios.  
 
=== ACTIONS ===
 * _*ACTION*_: Joe will add something to wiki about cfengine. 
 * _*ACTION*_: Marcos and Eric will work together to get Marcos access to the ESnet test servers for doing LS performance testing.
 * _*ACTION*_: Maxim will work with Andy and Aaron to debug the pingER-MP problem.
 * _*ACTION*_: Jason will send the psps related publications Internet2 has been working on.
