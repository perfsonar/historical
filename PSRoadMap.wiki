= Performance Monitoring (perfSONAR) =

<wiki:toc max_depth="6" />

== Synopsis ==
The primary short-term goals for perfSONAR development is: to harden and make useful GUIs for existing backbone, regional, and community related deployments (i.e. the LHC community), enable diagnostics of dynamic circuits, and to add the features needed to entice additional deployments into regionals, campuses, and labs.

==== pS-PS 3.1 Enhancements ====

  * OWAMP support in perfSONAR-BUOY
  * gLS/hLS packages
  * gLS/hLS performance and stability updates
  * CGI based GUIs
    * gLS/hLS GUIs
    * simple data GUIs for owamp/bwctl/pingER/SNMP
  * Circuit Monitoring (glif version, still E2EMon compatible)
  * Additions to pS-NPToolkit to enable Zero-Config mode
  * yum/apt packaging

==== pS-PS 3.1+ enhancements ====

In support of the CTP project (*if applicable*). Otherwise, some of these things will be postponed and/or cancelled.

  * Nagios pluggins for threshold alarms on performance data
  * Enhanced CGI script for owamp data (dash-board)
  * Modified pS-B owamp database back-end with support for history of delay-variation

==== pS-NPToolkit 3.1 (last knoppix version) ====

  * Use new versions of owamp/bwctl and pS-PS 3.1(+)
  * Minimal-configuration start-up for diagnostic
  * All Administration via HTTP
  * Stability and performance enhancements
  * Community specific operations

==== pS-PS 3.2 enhancements ====

  * Monitoring of DCN-created circuits
  * Discovery APIs
    * Well structured, documented - designed for application programmers
  * limited AA integration

==== pS-NPToolkit 3.2 ====

  * Fedora-Live based (drop knoppix) to enable ISO building from rpms
  * Use pS-PS 3.2

==== pS-Performance Grid 4.0 ====

  * LS - Topology based service queries (nearest MP problem)
  * Centralized Configuration Service
  * GUI enhancements
    * User community centric - search for problems relating to X
  
==== pS-NPDomain 4.0 ====

  * Allow an administrator to control a set of pS-performance nodes
  * Combination of yum repository and centralized configuration management tools

=== pS Schedule ===

These dates are very aggressive, but do assume approximately the current resources. (With a guess that some small fraction of additional funding will come through from grant submissions.)
