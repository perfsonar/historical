== Agenda/Minutes ==

 # Attendees: Marcos, Brian, Aaron, Jason, Joe, Jeff, Priscilla
 # Team Updates:
    * Marcos: Researching fault analysis.
    * Brian: Testing new releases. Found a few minor things. Strange things on ESnet measurements. hLS registration bug. Wants more testing before final release.
    * Aaron: Working on the toolkit - adding in dojo for web-gui to add cross-browser compatibility and tooltips.
    * Jason: Release activities - bug tracking. Late next week.
    * Joe: Gave feedback on an early RC and nothing since. Joe will send a request for psps.perfsonar.net and mdm.perfsonar.net.
    * Jeff: Release/bug activities. Mostly working on proposals.
    * Priscilla: Joining to hear how things are going.
 # Release Activities
   * pS-PerformanceTK
        * Getting good feedback, lots of bugs to followup on.
        * Will likely have at least two more RCs given the number of bugs. (Next one late next week.)
 # Testing
    * Brian will work with Marcos, Martin and perhaps Joe on gLS/hLS testing for scaling.
 # LHC/Atlas deployments (status update)
    * Giving good feedback.
    * GridFTP archive service from SLAC is on the horizon.
 # Future topics:
   * Service Monitoring and Config management
     * gLS 'monitoring'
  * Status collection for low-level device PMs
    The DCN status page that was put together for the monitoring is a relatively simple collector that grabs various performance counters and other data about elements on the Cienas. Right now, it confines itself to things that look like interfaces. There's a similar project that Jon Dugan has been working on for ESnet called ESxSNMP that grabs performance counters for SNMP hosts. It would be good to have a discussion about how these two monitoring infrastructures might work together. At minimum, it might be feasible to get the TL1 monitoring components to use the same metadata database and counter databases, and, implicitly, perfsonar interface.
    = =
    Another possible area of discussion include how the monitoring above can be extended to support collection and storage of topological information. The topology information could include how interfaces are connected together internally in the switch/router (via cross-connects, adaptation or whatever). It might also be good to think about how to collect information about how switches/routers are wired together.
    = =
    It'd be feasible to grab and store TL1/SNMP alarms as part of the collection framework. Though, that might be more reasonably done via nagios plugins.
 # Next VC will be 8/24 2:30 EDT.

=== ACTIONS ===

    * Joe will send request for implementation specific web sites in perfsonar.net space.
    * Joe will send email to EU participants to find out who will be at DICE meeting.
    * Brian will work with Marcos, Martin and perhaps Joe on scalability testing of the hLS/gLS.
