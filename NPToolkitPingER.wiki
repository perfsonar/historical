PingER comes pre-configured, but it is possible to add and delete from this basic list of hosts.

== PingER Config Step 1 ==

Like most of the GUIs it is necessary to log in with the _*knoppix*_ user or some other configured username.

== PingER Config Step 2 ==

The GUI looks like this by default, populated with several services.

Mousing over any entry shows the exact host.  Changes may be made here.
