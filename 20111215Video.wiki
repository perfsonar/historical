=  December 15, 2011 Conference Call 11:30 a.m. EDT =

== Agenda ==
  * Attendees: Jeff, Joe, Andy, Sowmya, Brian, Nils, Sowmya, Kavitha
     * Excused: 
  * Brainstorming for perfSONAR vision/problem statement
     * For list of ideas see [2012DevelopmentIdeasBrainstorm]
     * Present coalesced list of problems we could leverage pS to solve. (Jeff)
      * Customers
       * Important for us to define customers
       * Important to show value with new development. Many of items in the list do tha.
       * Jeff: One such thing is to provide more detailed information about individual flows
        * Brian: We have looked at that in the past and most people have good commericial solutions
        * Jeff: They are not interdomain
        * Brian: Not clear that security people wouldn't cause it to be abstracted to uselessness
        * Jeff: Possible that's not the case
        * Discussion today will be slightly more blue sky and less focused on what resources will do what. Need to prioritize items, can focus on how far done the list after the end of the year
        * Jeff: Analysis might be important, helps end-users that are not network engineers
        * Brian: Could spend most of time on documentation
         * Jeff: That will help current users, may not grow user community
        * Brian: another way is to grow developer community
        * Brian: how do we make more useful to CIO?
         * Jeff: End-user tools that say "can i do this video conference" users from the campus get this bandwidth. These are the top bandwidth campuses. 
         * Brian: New things ike netflow would be hard to deploy, but could build map from current bwctl or throughput data
        * Joe: @Jeff are you looking at SLA verification or anything down that path?
         * Jeff: I was, but less now. In some ways you can think of nagios work as that. 
     * Joe: A lot of these fall in broad categories
      * Most of the tools are good for letting us detect problems in other domains...not problems we can solve
     * Jeff: In past relied on end-user to talk how useful it is. Also have wanted them to build apps.
     * Brian: Creating better APIs and libs would help this
     * Brian: Say we have top sites and bottom sites list? what happens when site is on bottom of the list.
      * In some ways like a campus version of speedtest.net
      * Joe is goal to raise the top 10%, thebottom 10% etc?
       * Jeff: could show differentiation between commercial nets and r&e nets. 
       * Jeff: we should maybe move up the stack and get performance data out of gridftp. that would also show value
     * *Summary of New Ideas:*
      * End-user tool (analysis of data)
      * Look at flow data
      * Pull performance stats out of GridFTP
      * Map that shows different campus performance 
      * Show Top 10% and Bottom 10% of campus performers
    * Jeff: There is a division of operational versus development tasks
    * Brian: We could start targeting new communities (i.e. climate)
    * Handling multple Nodes
     * Some people want to have multiple nodes, register to single MA
     * Groups like USATLAS want way to easily setup the tests (i.e. import export tests)
     * Andy: Low hanging fruit might be to export owmesh file content to URL and allow other hosts to point to it
     * Jeff; Centralized MA might not be hard
     * *New Idea:*  - Jeff - Integrate ping into bwctl. Should be easy.
     * GLIF uses pinger
      * What's priority? 
     * Helps people installing, makes life easier but does not necessarily allow them to do new things
     * Joe: VOs might want to do template so this might be useful
     * *New Idea:* - Aaron - If more stuff ran under bwctl could do third-party tests. Have one central host that executes all test, 
     * Run into issues of centralized vs distributed architecture
     * Need better AA in place likely to do some of this
     * *Who benefits:* VOs, users with multiple nodes
     * *Decided Priority:* LOW
    * *New Idea:* Make tools more firewall friendly (i.e. move all to port 80 or 443)
     * Web services might be easier
     * For owamp and bwctl mighthave to tunnel
     * Aaron: For owamp definitely couldn't tunnel everything. tunnelling udp or tcp makes it not udp.
     * Jeff: would have to violate RFC to make it on one port, but might be possible.
     * Not sure if it would be easy to setup tunnels either without manual intervention
     * Things like Netalyzer only use port 80 - maybe uses some other ports
     * UDP hard to support in firewalled environments. Would capturing different stats be helpful? Loss is useful but can get that from places than OWAMP. 
      * Need to evaluate what stats are unique to owamp that we can't get anywhere else
      * Maybe can find tcp tool that looks at queueing 
      * TCP solutions will never be perfect measures of loss - lots of things can cause retransmits
     * *Who benefits:* Network engineers at DOE labs, campuses, hospitals because easier to deploy. 
     * *Decided priority:* Medium
    * Lookup Service
     * Lost of problems: stability, architecture requires lots of queries to all services
     * Three types of issues
      * XMLDB issues
      * Cache issues
      * Query model
     * Priority: Low-High (depending on which problem)
    * Better analysis
     * NDT or Detective for historical data
     * Traceroute GUI
     * Custom dashboard (like ESnet)
     * Does good job of highligting value
     * *Priority:* High
    * Climages
     * Better data summarization. 
      * May be low hanging fruit in GUI space. 
      * Keeping raw data is a matter of disk space. May be low hanging fruit in keep last 1 hour of raw data.
      * *Priority:* Low
     * better reporting mechanism
      * Example: Send around email saying "your network performed this well, this week"
      * *Priority:* High
     * More end-user development work
      * In addition, want to grow open source project
      * App store 
       * Lots of stuff out there
       * Part of this would be guidelines for people to get accepted in the app store
      * REST APIs
       * Would this help get us any new developers?
       * Have people trying to 1) display own data and 2) grab other peoples data.
       * Another way is better docs and client libraries.
       * Could do this incrementally.
      * Priority: High for overall topic (need to decide individual priorities)
    * Layer 2 Information
     * A good end-user tool would be useful in this space.
     * Who does this benefit: Network engineers, maybe end-user if easy to tell traffic is on circuit
     * *Priority:* Medium(?)
    * Next Steps:
     * Meet after at the end of the year to come up with homework assignments and digest priorities.
  * Determine how existing 'issues' map to identified needs.
  * Assign homework to determine resources needed to accomplish identified outcomes.
