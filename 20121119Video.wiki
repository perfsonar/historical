== Notes ==
  * Web 10G 
    * Next Monday can give you an RPM of the kernel to try with toolkit. Stats seem accurate, things look pretty good
    * After that, looking at porting issues for NDT. Shouldn't be too bad. 
    * 32-bit and 64-bit version available
    * Andrew will take first crack at trying it
  * SCinet lesson learned
    * perfSONAR stuff went pretty smoothly
    * MaDDash generator bug fixed
    * Changed OWAMP subsession from 1 minute to 5 minutes. Wondering if we should do this for general release?
     * Issue was disk write issue most likely. RAID couldn't keep up with write speed. 
     * Potentially could make graphs a bit more confusing
     * Would be less data to deal with, but may be better off dealing with new MA
    * When do we want to release mesh stuff?
     * Planning to do it with rest of stuff
     * Needs to finish documentation
    * MaDDash changes
     * Added options so could add custom label for hosts 
    * Multi-homed bwctl host
     * Used scripts from Dave Lesny that replace iperf command with shell script that setup routes
     * Might be useful if we can generalize
     * Adding pre- and post- hooks to bwctl and owamp might help this situation (already has post)
  * Release status
   * Would like to do something in mid-December
   * Roughly half issues are fixed.
   * Would like to do 32 bit and 64 bit versions
   * Will start doing issue review at meetings
  * No meeting next Monday
